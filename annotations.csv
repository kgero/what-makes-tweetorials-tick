Turns out human activity is a major driver of California‚Äôs wildfires, but not just in the ways you might imagine. (pic: Noah Berger) 1/10 https://t.co/aX1CIJSrGi ~tweetbreak~ Fires need 3 things to burn: fuel, oxygen, and ignition. A warming climate means less rain and less humidity, which means that California‚Äôs vegetation - potential fuel - is dryer than before. 2/10 ~tweetbreak~ Drier fuels‚Äîgrasses, shrubs, forests‚Äîcatch fire more easily, allowing fires to grow bigger and spread faster. So, there‚Äôs your fuel. Next, oxygen‚Ä¶ 3/10 ~tweetbreak~ When you build a fire in a fireplace, you use a bellows or hearty lungfuls of air to blow oxygen across lit kindling and get the flames really crackling. The state of CA has its own natural bellows. 4/10 ~tweetbreak~ The Santa Anna winds in Southern CA and the Diablo winds in Northern CA are powerful wind events that have been happening in the fall for thousands of years. But climate change is both making them stronger‚Ä¶ 5/10 https://t.co/Jji2AJ3qv0 ~tweetbreak~ and extending the hot, dry period in the fall, when these powerful winds arrive after months of little, if any, rain. When these winds gust across the tinderbox of parched vegetation, all you need is a spark to ignite a crisis. 6/10 ~tweetbreak~ Which brings us to ignition.

You can either roll poo, or you wait to ambush another beetle rolling poo ~tweetbreak~ So if you're rolling poo, you wanna roll it the hell out of there as fast as possible in case you're going to get ambused ~tweetbreak~ Fastest way to get somewhere? A straight line. So dung beetles push their ball in as straight line as possible. Simple, right? ~tweetbreak~ How do dung beetles keep such a straight line? Marie Dacke, a biologist at Lund University in Sweden found they observed the sun and moon ~tweetbreak~ During the day they watch the sun and during the night they use polarised light from the moon. This was back in 2003. Good so far https://t.co/eFBWlIGD8K ~tweetbreak~ If you put the beetle in a walled area so it can't see surroundings, it uses the moon. Takes 20 secs to get to a wall ~tweetbreak~ Put a lid on top so it can't see the moon and now it takes 2 mins on average to hit a wall because they can't keep a straight line ~tweetbreak~ This is what happens if you have a light source at the top turned on and then turn on the one at 90 degrees instead. It changes course https://t.co/3mpZjBvlwf ~tweetbreak~ Marie Dacke observed something weird in the following years. If the beetle can see the sky but it's a moonless night, it still does well ~tweetbreak~ 40 seconds with moonless night sky rather than expected 2 minutes. Was she wrong? Is it not really about the moon? So she studied further ~tweetbreak~ They can't be using the stars because the beetle's eyes are too shit for that. Where you see a star they see darkness. So what gives? ~tweetbreak~ She did things like turn only the brightest stars on, or only dimmer ones, and all sorts of weird experiments to see what the beetle did ~tweetbreak~ Get this, the dung beetle can't see an individual star but it CAN see the Milky Way. Our spiral galaxy. It orients itself by our galaxy https://t.co/68sIhnLrtx ~tweetbreak~ Dung beetles might be lowly, smelly, poo-pushers but hey they're the only insect we know that observes our galaxy and I think that's cool ~tweetbreak~ We think of bio as small and astronomical objects as huge and separate but things interact even at these differences in scale https://t.co/JowHzbEXAt",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

It's irresistible on the rack. It has no fewer than 18 buttons. At least 3 people are needed to get a screaming baby into it. It's worn once, so you can send a photo to the gifter, then discarded. ~tweetbreak~ Other baby outfits are meant for parents. They‚Äôre marked ""Easy On, Easy Off"" or some such, and they really mean it. Zippers aren't easy enough so they fasten using MAGNETS.

Such products don't HAVE to end up as unusable garbage, but usually do. ~tweetbreak~ OK, back to Blackboard! It‚Äôs actually designed to look extremely attractive to the administrators (not professors and definitely not students) who make purchase decisions. Since they can't easily test usability, they instead make comparisons based on‚Ä¶ checklists of features. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ~tweetbreak~ And that's exactly what's wrong with Blackboard.

Blackboard's market share has dropped dramatically and this will probably continue. Good. ~tweetbreak~ Here‚Äôs the kicker, though. It's extremely likely that whichever vendor emerges on top will fall into the same trap. The incentives almost guarantee it. Once profs and students put down the pitchforks, committees will go back to their checklists, and feature creep will resume. ~tweetbreak~ Blackboard is 20 years old.

""Why do my fingers get all wrinkly when I take a bath?‚Äù This was the question my 3-year-old daughter asked me recently after bath time. 

I thought for a minute, then realized I didn't have a clue. 

The explanation is so much cooler than I had expected... https://t.co/mFyeKm8Edc ~tweetbreak~ 2/
Let me throw a version of my daughter's question out to you:

Which of the following contributes to ‚Äúwater immersion wrinkling""? ~tweetbreak~ 3/
For 40 years, I have observed, like my daughter, that my fingers look like prunes after being in water. I‚Äôve assumed that they lost water (became dehydrated), just like prunes! 

But, that can‚Äôt be. When I submerge my hand in water, I‚Äôm placing it into a hypotonic solution. ~tweetbreak~ 4/
Reminder:

Plasma osmolality: ~285 mOsm/kg
Water osmolality: ~0 mOsm/kg

If anything, water should flow IN and make my fingertips MORE swollen. ~tweetbreak~ 5/
It's true that water enters fingers after immersion. The portals of entry are likely sweat glands (which are highly concentrated in the hands).

But, fingers appear to shrink, not swell. And it‚Äôs not uniform.

Something else must be going on.

https://t.co/VZy5eYjbJe https://t.co/v6Pu1uACP3 ~tweetbreak~ 6/
A major clue came in 1936 when Lewis and Pickering published their observation that skin innervated by a palsied median nerve failed to wrinkle. This suggested the phenomenon wasn‚Äôt simply about water flow, but that it also involved the nervous system.

https://t.co/fWZ85C43VA https://t.co/JjOYHEceZY ~tweetbreak~ 7/
It appears that nerve activation is essential to water immersion wrinkling. But what does increase nerve firing lead to? 

Sympathetic mediated vasoconstriction!

https://t.co/16WSpF9myW ~tweetbreak~ 8/
The same group that suggested vasoconstriction as a contributor to wrinkling also offered a reason for why we experience it more on the glabrous skin (i.e., smooth/hairless) of the fingertips and toes. ~tweetbreak~ 9/
Two keys regarding fingertip anatomy:

*anchoring of the epidermis to the dermis results in varying skin tautness (max where skin is anchored)
*distal digital pulp has a high concentration of blood vessels and lots of glomus bodies (AV shunts surrounded by connective tissue) ~tweetbreak~ 10/
When glomus bodies lose volume through vasoconstriction, a negative pulp pressure is generated. The result is a downward pull on the overlying skin. 

Because dermal anchoring is not uniform in the fingertips, there is variable pull.

Result: WRINKLING! ~tweetbreak~ 11/
In 2004 a more complete mechanism was proposed:

water enters via sweat glands ‚û°Ô∏è electrolyte abnormalities ‚û°Ô∏è decreased membrane stability ‚û°Ô∏è increased nerve firing ‚û°Ô∏è vasoconstriction, particularly within dermal pulp ‚û°Ô∏è pull-down of overlying skin ‚û°Ô∏è wrinkles ~tweetbreak~ 12/
Is there a way we can make use of this information clinically, or is it just cocktail party fodder?

Well, if a functioning peripheral nerve is required for water immersion wrinkling, maybe its presence/absence can be used to test for neuropathy‚Ä¶ ~tweetbreak~ 13/
Since the 1970s, numerous groups have studies exactly this. 

It‚Äôs been used in diseases causing neuropathies as diverse as diabetes (PMID 6734390) and leprosy (PMID 3006371).

https://t.co/wbjWBdMDv2
https://t.co/0S046esGk1 https://t.co/bH821fa6Yk ~tweetbreak~ 14/
Have you ever used fingertip wrinkling to evaluate nerve function? ~tweetbreak~ 15/
Before closing, let‚Äôs return to the original question: 

Which of the following contributes to ‚Äúwater immersion wrinkling""? ~tweetbreak~ 16/
Next time my daughter takes a bath, I'll explain that her fingers look like raisins because she has intact sympathetic vasoconstriction with resulting retraction of fingertip pulp and that the density of eccrine sweat glands in her hands contributes.

What do people think happened with African empires &amp; their European counterparts prior to colonization? Perhaps a history lesson is in order. Thread. 1/17 ~tweetbreak~ There were so many different African empires, so I‚Äôm gonna stick to the empire from which I‚Äôm descended--the Benin Empire (what is now Benin City in Edo State in southern Nigeria)--and its relationship with the Portuguese since the early 15th century. 2/17 ~tweetbreak~ The Benin empire interacted with the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese throughout its existence, but the Benin-Portugal relationship was the chummiest. They traded goods, languages, histories, lessons. They sent emissaries and scholars to each other &amp; threw big shindigs. 3/17 ~tweetbreak~ The Lagos y‚Äôall know? Portuguese word for ‚Äúlake,‚Äù named back when the land that is now Lagos was still a part of the Benin Empire. Benin Obas spoke Portuguese and sent their subjects to learn about Christianity. Early Benin art had crosses mixed with its own pantheon. 4/17 ~tweetbreak~ The Portuguese wanted slaves so Benin sold its POWs. They wanted spices, ivory &amp; coral beads, and offered textiles, tools &amp; weapons in return. They established a factory at Ughoton, Benin‚Äôs then seaport city (long before Lagos became one of West Africa‚Äôs key slaveports). 5/17 ~tweetbreak~ David van Nyendael, on visiting Benin in 1699: ‚ÄúWhen it comes to trade, they are very strict and will not suffer the slightest infringement of their customs...when one is willing to accept these customs, they are very easy-going and will cooperate in every way possible.‚Äù 6/17 ~tweetbreak~ No surprise, then, that the first point of contention arrived when King Manuel of Portugal wanted commercial monopoly, as well as for the Binis to fully accept Christianity, to which Oba Esigie was like, ‚ÄúExcuse you?‚Äù The decline in trade relations began after that. 7/17 ~tweetbreak~ Then, there was also disease. Them weak-ass sailors would get bitten by one tiny-ass anopheles mosquito and be like, ‚Äú*cough cough* Ugh, tell my wife I love her.‚Äù The French especially suffered from this.

Then the British arrived, and it all went to shit from there. 8/17 ~tweetbreak~ Buoyed by that nonsense Berlin Conference of 1885 (smh), the British started asking for trade monopoly and control. They were so aggressive about it that the Oba banned all other trade with them, save for palm oil (to aid lubrication in the burgeoning European machine age). 9/17 ~tweetbreak~ Proud-ass Britain didn‚Äôt like being told what to do. They wrote stink pieces, commenced disinformation campaigns. Here‚Äôs Consul Richard Burton, in 1862: ‚Äú...a place of gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death."" (Like we haven‚Äôt seen Oliver Twist. Pot/kettle much?) 10/17 ~tweetbreak~ By 1897, the consuls had convinced the Queen with enough lies to gather an army to take Benin by force. ‚ÄúLiberate the people‚Äù and convert them to Christianity. (Sound familiar, y‚Äôall summer missionary cruisers to the Caribbean with a side-dish of ‚Äúconverting the natives?‚Äù) 11/17 ~tweetbreak~ The 1897 Benin Expedition &amp; deposition of Oba Ovonramwen happened then. You can read about it anywhere (except the British Museum‚Äôs revisionist take, to which I cackled when I visited). TL;DR, Benin was overrun, palace burnt, Oba exiled, art carted to Britain‚Äôs museums. 12/17 ~tweetbreak~ In similar fashion, the British colonized everywhere that is now Nigeria, sucked off resources of countless groups until 1960. Then they drew border lines, binding this mix of tribes, languages &amp; customs, &amp; threw a few coins at them. ‚ÄúShoo, now. Go take care of yourselves.‚Äù 13/17 ~tweetbreak~ So when people say, ‚Äúcolonialism benefited Africans,‚Äù this is why I want to wash their mouths with a soap bar.

‚ÄúBut the Africans got technology,‚Äù you say. ‚ÄúBecame modern.‚Äù

You mean like they would‚Äôve done if they had continued to, I dunno, trade on their own terms? 14/17 ~tweetbreak~ Why do folks behave like Europe &amp; Asia didn‚Äôt once have limited tech? They progressed through partnerships &amp; exchange, like all colonized peoples should‚Äôve had the chance to. Name one never-disenfranchised nation that is not currently working toward global contention. 15/17 ~tweetbreak~ In fact, Benin was actually one of the leaders in architecture at their time.

OK, so there's a physical problem with our eyes: We move them in short fast bursts called ""saccades"", right? very quick, synchronized movements.
The only problem is: they go all blurry and useless during this ~tweetbreak~ having your vision turn into a blurry mess every time you move your eyes is obviously not a good idea, so our brains hide it from us. Now, imagine you're an engineer and you have this problem. ~tweetbreak~ You've got some obvious solutions you could do.
1. make the vision go black during movement. (Some VR games do this!)
2. just keep showing the last thing we saw prior to movement ~tweetbreak~ both are good options with different downsides, but OH NO. this is assuming everything makes sense and is chronological and (regular) logical. 
Your brain does neither of these options, really. ~tweetbreak~ first, it basically puts your visual system on ""pause"". You're not seeing blackness or even nothing, you're just not seeing period.
then when you finish your saccade, it shows you what you now see at the new position. and then it pretends it can time travel. ~tweetbreak~ it seriously shows you the image at the new point, but time-shifts it backwards so that it seems like you were seeing it the whole time your eyes were moving.
And because your brain is not a computer with a consistent clock, this shit works. ~tweetbreak~ you can see this effect happen if you watch an analog clock with a second hand.
Look away (with just your eyes, not your head), then look back to the second hand.
It'll seem like it takes longer than a second to move, then resumes moving as normal. ~tweetbreak~ that's because your freaking visual system just lied to you about HOW LONG TIME IS in order to cover up the physical limitations of those chemical camera orbs you have on the front of your face. ~tweetbreak~ we've known about this effect for over 100 years, it's called ""Saccadic masking"" and more specifically Chronostasis. Your visual system lies to you about WHEN things happen by up to half a second(!) just to avoid saccades blurring everything. ~tweetbreak~ So while I firmly believe we're basically just overgrown biological computers, we're apparently computers programmed by batshit insane drunkards in Visual Basic 5. ~tweetbreak~ and you might think ""hey wait, wouldn't my vision 'pausing' for half a second have all kinds of weird effects on moving objects? why don't they appear to stutter when moving?""
and the answer is simple! your brain has EVEN MORE UGLY HACKS on top of this to avoid you seeing that ~tweetbreak~ if you've got a clock where the second hand doesn't ""tick"" but instead smoothly rotates, you won't see this. Because your brain recognizes it's moving and adjusts what you see to make sure it sees the ""right"" thing. ~tweetbreak~ it's only really obvious with periodically moving things like a clock hand, because it's not moving (so not triggering the movement-during-chronostatis hack) but it moves at a set rate, so you can notice that rate appearing to change. ~tweetbreak~ It's tempting to think of your eyes and visual system as a camera just dumping a video feed into your conscious brain but that's so very, very not the case.

What does it mean that the median age of new cases is dropping in some areas? I see three possible explanations, not all good. A thread on how to distinguish between them. 1/10

(Figure h/t @ScottGottliebMD) https://t.co/Y6m45qoBL6 ~tweetbreak~ Explanation 1: More testing.

As we do more testing in the community, we are able to capture more mild or even asymptomatic infections. This is especially true for routine workplace testing. As younger people have milder disease, this shifts the age distribution lower. 2/10 ~tweetbreak~ If median age drops because of more testing only, we expect:

- Increase in number of cases detected across all age groups
- Test positivity to drop in all age groups (size of drop depends on which groups are targeted for testing)
- No change in hospitalizations
3/10 ~tweetbreak~ Explanation 2: Elderly people are more cautious.

Median age could also drop if the elderly were protecting themselves better, even with no change in testing. For example, we are preventing more nursing home outbreaks. 4/10 ~tweetbreak~ If median age drops only because the elderly are more cautious, we expect:

- Drop in number of new cases in the elderly
- Drop in test positivity among the elderly (fever/illness is more likely due to other non-COVID causes)
- Drop in hospitalizations (after a lag)
5/10 ~tweetbreak~ Explanation 3 (the not good one): Young people are less cautious.

This is distinct from the previous scenario. It means that young people are being infected even more than before. This could occur if there are many bar/nightclub or workplace outbreaks. 6/10 ~tweetbreak~ If median age drops only because young people are being infected more, we expect:

- Numbers of new cases to rise in young people
- Test positivity to increase in young people
- More young people being hospitalized (after a lag)
7/10 ~tweetbreak~ Besides the fact that young people can face unknown long-term outcomes of infection, they can also inadvertently spread the virus to their communities. So the median age could start to creep back up if it moves from bars out to coworkers, family members, etc. 8/10 ~tweetbreak~ The reality is almost certainly some mixture of all three explanations. In this figure (h/t @trvrb), test positivity drops for everyone (more testing), but most in the elderly (more protection). But it is flatlining in 18-49 y/o and could start increasing (more infection). 9/10 https://t.co/t8tSUg3scL ~tweetbreak~ Ultimately, we need more high quality age-stratified data on cases, testing, and hospitalizations.

First, let's stop calling it opposition research. Real researchers don't call it that...so let's stop talking about it like we're in the movies. Second, let me clarify what research is and isn't. Again, this isn't the movies. ~tweetbreak~ 3. Research for political campaigns, political action committees, independent expenditure committees is about publicly available information. Now you may wonder, if its publicly available why campaigns have to pay people good money for publicly available info. ~tweetbreak~ 4. Putting together publicly available information is not only arduous and exhausting, you would be surprised by how much people miss because they don't know how and where to look for information. Now, what qualifies as publicly available information? ~tweetbreak~ 5. Court records, voter registration records, if the candidate is a legislator, their voting record, transcripts of committee hearings, ethics records, every single news clip about them, every video they've ever appeared in from small Democratic Party BBQs to..(cont) ~tweetbreak~ 6. Speeches at women's groups to videos from supporters (or haters) on the sidelines of parades. Real estate and tax records. If they own a business or ran a business: employment records, regulatory records (OSHA stuff), licensing records). This is a very short list of examples ~tweetbreak~ 7. So here's what research isn't...it's not about gossip, it's not about stuff that sources tell you, and as a researcher, you're not flying to some remote town to talk to people unless it's to talk to the city clerk about divorce records that aren't digitized. ~tweetbreak~ 8. So how does research get commissioned? Here's an example. A candidate is running for Senator, they're already an officeholder (let's say state senator). First, they'll commission a self-research packet (which often means several large binders/pdfs). In that packet... ~tweetbreak~ 9. They'll find every public statement (of note) they've ever made, donors or fundraisers that may cause issues for them (if they're smart they would vett donors before they take $$), everything re their voting record, videos - all the stuff I talked about earlier in the thread. ~tweetbreak~ 10. Then when they launch their campaign, a smart manager/general consultant won't have full research books done on every candidate. A book will only be done on one or two candidates at most normally but the manager will request top line hits on some other candidates ~tweetbreak~ 11. Top line hits mean that the researcher can put stuff together in a couple days usually and involve any tax liens, lawsuits, controversial videos/statements, bad business stuff etc. ~tweetbreak~ 12. Now, what researchers do that's so critical is they know, they have a sense of what matters in campaigns. They don't just plop all the information in a binder, they organize it in a way that prioritizes the information. They also, often, construct a narrative ~tweetbreak~ 13. So at the start of a book (if the researcher is good) you'll find basic information on the candidate, everything from DOB to addresses, marriages, children, social media accounts. Then you'll find a timeline of their life. From birth to present day. Timeline is critical ~tweetbreak~ 14. Because it allows the campaign team to understand where they may find more information OR (and this is where I talk about reporters)..its where they can guide reporters. So, for example, a press person can tell a reporter ""hey, Joe Smith lived in North Dakota for a year.."" ~tweetbreak~ 15. That may peak the reporters interest, that information may not have been easily available. The reporter may wonder why someone who spent their entire life in Southern California randomly lived in North Dakota for a year. Maybe there's something there? ~tweetbreak~ 16. Research books those two big sections are organized in sections after that (ex. voting record, real estate records etc). There are normally a few subsections on each page, a title for that subsection and then normally a paragraph of info under that section. Example... ~tweetbreak~ 17. ""Joe Smith Accepted $300,000 in donations from Oil Companies"" - then the paragraph may include something like this ""including $25,000 from Alan Jones who was fined by the EPA 120 separate times."" All of this is publicly available. ~tweetbreak~ 18. Another section may start with something like this ""Joe Smith, When He Was A City Council Member, Repeatedly Prevented The Council From Settling With A Sexual Harassment Victim."" Again, old records but public records. These are all great ""hits"" on a candidate ~tweetbreak~ 19. There's so much more and the thing that researchers get really good at is learning what will really make an impact. Think the oil company donations will make a difference? Probably not. What will make a difference? That Joe Smith had 20 unpaid parking tickets. ~tweetbreak~ 20. May sound silly to some but that's the kind of thing that pisses of voters and makes them wonder about that candidates ability to handle simple stuff. So here's a little something about researchers.. ~tweetbreak~ 21. Researchers are not shadowy figures who look like PIs in movies. They're nerdy, they look more like someone you'd find at the Genius Bar at Apple than an FBI. Field Office. Researchers are obsessive and odd. Soo many of the researchers I know are obsessed with unusual things ~tweetbreak~ 22. Several researchers I know are obsessed with learning languages like Greek and Latin. They get true joy from finding stuff no one else did. They're not driven by destroying someone but by uncovering the truth..no matter who it is about or where it is. ~tweetbreak~ 23. Ok so you have your research book...do you just hand it over to reporters? NO! I have never known anyone to ever do this..ever! Oppo dump is a ridiculous term. Most of the time, 99% of the research stays with the campaign. The candidate uses it to beef up on their opponent ~tweetbreak~ 24. The research is used for social media posts, debates (a big one), tv, digital, and radio ads, and for stump speeches. What is passed onto reporters? Really really big stuff. So if a researcher finds a really incriminating video on Youtube or some bad real estate records ~tweetbreak~ 25. The campaign will pass that stuff onto the reporter. This happens in several ways, sometimes they'll just give reporters records, other times they'll say ""look into X"", sometimes if its a complicated issue they'll sit down with the reporter and walk them through it. (cont) ~tweetbreak~ 26. What isn't done, again, is a reporter getting a pile of research thrown on their desk (""oppo dump"") and they figure it out. Campaigns don't do this because they want to keep reporters focused on their narrative (good reporters aren't going to be guided by that, but..) ~tweetbreak~ 27. From the campaign perspective, you don't just dump stuff. Campaigns also try to carefully time the sharing of any research with reporters closer to Election Day...the October surprise is a real thing...Now, let's talk about a story that came out tonight ~tweetbreak~ 28. This story by @aterkel @mtredden about Amy Klobuchar's workplace conduct. So many people tweeted ""oppo dump!"" which is wrong. It wasn't and here's why, nothing that's in the story was publicly available. All based on sourcing https://t.co/qhWMiodmSB ~tweetbreak~ 29. Now this may have been from research if, for example, the reporting was based on ethics records that never got any attention. But most of the time stories like that come from reporters digging around, not researchers handing them stuff. Trust me, would make things easier! ~tweetbreak~ 30. So this story was about @aterkel @mtredden knowing about Klobuchar's reputation (which many people knew about) and calling around to sources to beef up the story, to back it up. That doesn't come from researchers. Researchers aren't private investigators. ~tweetbreak~ 31. I could go on all night but I just wanted to clear something up about who researchers are, what they do, and how they do it. It's truly above board work, it's not dark and nefarious. ~tweetbreak~ 32. And please don't attack reporters by accusing them of colluding with campaigns, when/if we do get tips with research we have to do 95 percent of the work to confirm and run down a story.",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

It affects the economy, biodiversity... and it's the basic research of our world that solves big problems ~tweetbreak~ The connection between basic research and world-changing applications can be loose and almost invisible to some people. Here comes a thread: ~tweetbreak~ I want to tell a little story. It'll just be a few tweets. It's about a famous physician called Sir Cyril Clarke (1907-2000) ~tweetbreak~ He didn't really do medical research when he was a physician but he did study butterflies and became a famous lepidopterist ~tweetbreak~ How's that for wasting time and money? Butterflies! This was in the 60s and his findings prompted him to suggest the idea of supergenes ~tweetbreak~ Being a physician right when modern genetics was taking off, he wanted to take what he was learning with butterflies and apply it to us ~tweetbreak~ This led directly to him studying blood groups as markers for diseases in humans rather than wing colouration in butterflies ~tweetbreak~ This research directly led to him studying Rh disease. If the mother is Rh negative and father Rh positive then immune system attacks fetus ~tweetbreak~ He worked alongside his wife and she came up with a genius and seemingly counter-intuitive idea: inject the anti-Rh anti-bodies in mother ~tweetbreak~ It worked. It was one of the biggest medical breakthroughs of the 20th century. We can reliably prevent Rh disease now and it saves lives ~tweetbreak~ It's been estimated that the prevention has saved around a million lives since it became standard. Think about that, a million people ~tweetbreak~ How many people can you name that have saved a million lives? And the point of all this: studying butterfly genetics led directly to this ~tweetbreak~ The very nature of basic research means we don't know exactly what research will lead to something important, but we're lost without it ~tweetbreak~ I think it's safe to say that studying butterflies is something these people would say is unimportat and a waste of resources ~tweetbreak~ Climate scientists are wasting money looking at clouds, ice, sea levels, biodiversity, and the air around you.

How do steroids cause an increase in the white blood cell (WBC) count (i.e., leukocytosis)? 

And, how do steroids tamp down inflammation if it appears that there are more WBCs in the blood after they are administered?

Seems like a paradox in need of a thread. https://t.co/9YqWInZLYC ~tweetbreak~ 2/
We've known for decades that the leukocytosis observed after the administration of steroids results from an increase in the neutrophil count.

Which of the following is the largest contributor to this post-steroid leukocytosis/neutrophilia?

[BM = bone marrow] ~tweetbreak~ 3/
The first three mechanisms all play a role. 

In the 1960s, many felt that an influx from the bone marrow was most responsible. One clue supporting this mechanism: patients with abnormal marrows show decreased post-steroid leukocytosis.

https://t.co/CnFIaz01NL https://t.co/W3tzZiqYqh ~tweetbreak~ 4/
If marrow influx were the only cause, inflammation would INCREASE with steroids. (Add more neutrophils and you should increase inflammation.)

But studies clearly show that the number of neutrophils in areas of inflammation DECREASE with steroids. 

https://t.co/P0Bbfyj233 https://t.co/LRFmVslsjl ~tweetbreak~ 5/
Another clue that increased bone marrow production isn't the predominant mechanism: the neutrophils seen after steroids are ""old"". 

This conclusion is based on decreased neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) level after steroids administration.

https://t.co/2ivLfjDJuT https://t.co/ZC0dXfBPpo ~tweetbreak~ 6/
More recent data suggests the following contributions to post-steroid leukocytosis:
*mobilization from marginated pool - 61%
*delayed apoptosis - 29%
*increased bone marrow production - 10%

https://t.co/UMzzYzW8Xp ~tweetbreak~ 7/
More than half of the leukocytosis results from ""demargination"". To understand this mechanism, recall that there are two pools of neutrophils within the circulation:
*circulating
*marginated

https://t.co/8MUjsW1pIR https://t.co/G2tn9W3o41 ~tweetbreak~ 8/
The marginated pool includes neutrophils that adhere to the endothelium of capillaries and postcapillary venules.

Areas rich in marginated neutrophils include the lungs, liver, and spleen. ~tweetbreak~ 9/
It's important to realize that when we order a white blood cell count, we do NOT ""see"" the marginated neutrophils on the report. We only see the circulating neutrophils.

So, a question: What fraction of neutrophils are circulating (C) versus marginated (M)? ~tweetbreak~ 10/
Approximately HALF of the neutrophils in the ""circulation"" aren't circulating (i.e., they're marginated)! This was demonstrated in 1961 in a study using radiolabeled neutrophils.

https://t.co/zA16qTnzWv https://t.co/cc2zycKcBV ~tweetbreak~ 11/
So, there certainly is a large pool of marginated neutrophils ready to contribute to post-steroid leukocytosis.

But, what do steroids ""do"" that moves neutrophils from the marginated pool to the circulating pool? ~tweetbreak~ 12/
In 1992, Cronstein showed that steroids inhibit ICAM-1 and ELAM-1 expression. Without these adhesion molecules neutrophils:

*don't leave the vascular space ‚û°Ô∏è decreased inflammation
*do move from marginated pool to circulating pool ‚û°Ô∏è leukocytosis!

https://t.co/gAJRzDWzrC https://t.co/wDWKrAv0L2 ~tweetbreak~ 13/
Based on the above, which of the following might also cause leukocytosis via demargination (i.e., movement from the marginated pool to the circulating pool)? ~tweetbreak~ 14/
Neutrophils need slower velocities to adhere. Things that increase blood flow are likely to cause fewer neutrophils to adhere/marginate.

Exercise and epinephrine have repeatedly been shown to cause demargination and leukocytosis.

https://t.co/zA16qTnzWv https://t.co/gtvWpxzBei ~tweetbreak~ 15/
Before summarizing, I'll re-ask the original question: Which of the following is the largest contributor to post-steroid leukocytosis/neutrophilia?

[BM = bone marrow] ~tweetbreak~ 16/
In summary:
‚≠êÔ∏èapproximately 50% of neutrophils in the circulation are marginated
‚≠êÔ∏èdemargination is likely the largest contributor to post-steroid leukocytosis
‚≠êÔ∏èdemargination also contributes to steroids' anti-inflammatory effects (i.e., neutrophils don't move into tissue)",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

I get where these people are coming from, but let's examine why this is a hollow argument. 1/ ~tweetbreak~ It's worth noting that I don't endorse Snowden's actions, but I DO have a better understanding than most what his options really were. So let's talk about that a little.

First, it's easy to say ""but whistleblower protections!"" That is the WORST POSSIBLE argument to use here. 2/ ~tweetbreak~ Intelligence community contractors didn't have whistleblower protections in 2013 when Snowden leaked. But the US government recognized what a problem this was and fixed it, right? Um, no. No they didn't. There may be a Snowden 2.0 festering in the IC right now as a result. 3/ ~tweetbreak~ What about ""he shouldn't have gone to Hong Kong""? Okay, but this assumes that anyone who wants to leak illegal activity by the IC should be ready to go to prison themselves. I'm not sure I'm there. I want people to be able to out illegal activity without threat of prison. 4/ ~tweetbreak~ The there's the question of ""why did he go to Russian then""? But that just demonstrates you don't know history (or refuse to Google). Russia was not the first country to offer Snowden asylum. Each country that offered before Russia withdrew the asylum offer. 5/ ~tweetbreak~ I can only assume there was a systematic operation by the State Department to pressure these other countries to withdraw their asylum offers. Russia just honey badgered it. Honestly, I think we created the Russia issue and it seems odd to focus on it now. 6/ ~tweetbreak~ Another popular argument is ""but Snowden must be giving Putin information now."" I'm not sure I believe this. His very presence in Russia is a middle finger to the US. The US housed not-insignificant numbers of Soviet political refugees during the cold war for the same reason. 7/ ~tweetbreak~ Finally, I'll address ""but why did he take more information than the domestic surveillance program info""? I think the simple answer is that Snowden didn't know what he didn't know. Ironically, the same who make the ""too much data"" argument like to hint at his lack of access. 8/ ~tweetbreak~ But we DO know that Snowden uncovered programs that effectively turned the Constitution into a Choose Your Own Adventure book. He watched DNI Clapper and Gen. Alexander (DIRNSA) lie about these programs, under oath, to oversight committees. This is indisputable. 9/ ~tweetbreak~ I do then think it's reasonable to ask ""what else don't I know?"" If you can get there, then I totally understand why he would take whatever he could get his hands on. If the goal is to leak data about illegal classified programs, why limit the scope? 10/ ~tweetbreak~ Anyway, I'll close with this:
1. There is no question the IC was breaking the law. The public only knows about it because of Snowden.
2. I'm no supporter of Snowden, but I also recognize this isn't a black and white issue. It's shades of grey. 11/ ~tweetbreak~ 3. Feel free to hold any opinion on his actions you want, but FFS educate yourself before sharing. For instance, before saying ""treason"" know the ACTUAL definition of the word and then be ready to explain how his actions amount to that. Any less is irresponsible hyperbole... 12/ ~tweetbreak~ 4. I won't be engaging sealions looking to argue in bad faith. I am not ""human Google."" Use Google to seek out facts before responding/asking for clarification of my positions. 13/ ~tweetbreak~ 5. I spent a lot of time away from my family engineering legitimate intelligence collection missions. Many of those suffered substantially from information revealed by the press as a result of the Snowden leaks. There is no love here. ""Hate"" is too strong, but so is ""like"" 14/ ~tweetbreak~ 6.

And here's why. This game exists because a metric (selectivity) exists. And metric exists because ... once upon a time a newsmagazine decided they could make some good side money ranking colleges. https://t.co/jlGQUfPFf3 ~tweetbreak~ Does ""selectivity"" actually tell you anything useful about how good your education will be? 

What does ""selectivity"" actually measure that is of value to a student? 

Why do I have the feeling somebody chose this metric cause they just needed more stuff to rank by? ~tweetbreak~ A few years ago, I read a research paper that used the US News and World Report college rankings as an example of how we take subjective arbitrary metrics and adopt them as representative of objective worth and then reshape whole systems around them. ~tweetbreak~ And it boils down to this: 
You could make a useful-to-students guide to colleges. But that takes a lot of reporting. Because many of the things students want to know are subjective and can't be well captured in numbers. And you have to do it, yourself, over and over. ~tweetbreak~ Or, you could come up with a bunch of metrics that colleges submit to you and that look scientific and objective. And that's a lot easier. Requires fewer reporters. Makes the universities compete for your favor in ways you can maybe monetize. So why not? ~tweetbreak~ That, my friends, was an editorial decision. 

An editorial decision that has had broad-ranging effects on how kids feel about themselves, how schools treat them, what schools feel pressured to spend $ on (and raise tuition for) ... ~tweetbreak~ And I guess the big takeaway for me is to spend more time thinking about the downstream effects of editorial decisions. When I make a choice, what could the consequences of that choice be? ~tweetbreak~ Well, that, and my usual rant about ""just because it's data doesn't mean it's objective fact that tells you what you need to know"". ~tweetbreak~ Relatedly, parents, keep this shit in mind when you're thinking about Great Schools rankings in your area. Ask questions about the metrics your public school is judged by. And then think about whether they are really telling you what you want to know. ~tweetbreak~ At one point, I was looking at a house in a neighborhood whose grade school at a ""2"" ranking with Great Schools. And I got all worried. And I looked into it. It had low test scores because more than 50% of its students were ESL. But the teachers were winning awards. ~tweetbreak~ The principal was beloved. It had some really cool after school robotics and language and arts stuff. 

It was not a bad school. It was a school that scored poorly on a ranking system. ~tweetbreak~ I once literally heard the principal at my kids' current school tell a prospective parent that part of why our school didn't score as high as another school across town was because we didn't hire a person whose sole job was to massage the Great Schools ranking.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0

The reason why I engage is to open up the arguments which I think are often more broadly held but not discussed. ~tweetbreak~ I think the following (wrong) position is commonplace: 
Ethnicity is mainly genetic. Physical + mental traits have varying levels of genetics; lots (height) to some (intelligence). Therefore part of the reason why ethnic groups have different education outcomes is genetic. ~tweetbreak~ People often will add that this ""part reason"" is small vs societal differences, but explains the lack of progression to the highest levels of some ethnic groups, and couple this whole statement with a strong ""equality under the law"" and individuals have to be treated the same. ~tweetbreak~ So - what is wrong with this position? Oddly enough the main things which are wrong is not what people expect - that genetic variation is a substantial component to the variation in intelligence measures / educational attainment. The genetics of intelligence measures are robust. ~tweetbreak~ Rather there are two things which wrong. The first is rather fundamental - many things can be genetic but not correlated to each other - your hair colour and intelligence measures for example, or your height and your chance of getting colon cancer ~tweetbreak~ So - saying two things have a genetic component in no way says that by tracking one thing (whatever the genetics is that goes into ethnic group determination) helps predict another thing (in this case measures of intelligence) ~tweetbreak~ This is because the genome is a very big place, and sex  shuffles randomly across it. It's complex to explain in detail;  think of it as if there are ~300,000 independent parts of the genome. Each parent passes on a pretty perfect shuffle between half of each of their parents. ~tweetbreak~ The second thing is that despite many people being pretty confident of their own ethnic group assignment (though not all!) and often confident about making snap assessments of other people (eg ""Afro-Caribbean"") ethnic groups labels are in fact a long way off genetics. ~tweetbreak~ There is a lot to unpick here. Ethnicity is often defined by a mixture of physical characteristics (skin colour is a big part, but there is more than that) and cultural aspects, in particular language, dress and mannerisms. ~tweetbreak~ Skin colour is not so much of the genome; in the 300,000 odd places in the genome it is at most 3,000 odd places (and that's being generous). Facial features, height etc might take you to up to 30,000 or so - most of the genome is not in the genetics of physical ethnicity traits ~tweetbreak~ This is most obviously recognisable in ""mixed race""  families, where it is often the case that children will have a big variation in skin colour and other attributes. ~tweetbreak~ But the ""formation"" of ethnic groups is also due to complex mixing of people's - both in terms of genetics and culture. Some have been recent, but some old and many we haven't traced out yet. ~tweetbreak~ For example, ""Europeans""  is a mix of three quite distinct groups : stone age hunter-gatherers, Anatolian farmers + Steppe pastoralists. Part of the population of Anatolian farmers migrated as well down the east coast of Africa, contributing genetics and likely farming culture ~tweetbreak~ Another massive migration was from Spain to central and south America, with the harsh Conquistador group having a large genetic and cultural stamp in combination with different native american people - this broad grouping leads to the Hispanic ethnic group ~tweetbreak~ Another obvious case is trans-atlantic slavery giving rise to a mixture of different genetic and cultural components from mainly from west africa plus European genetics and culture and then, in particular in the Caribbean, south Asian due to indentured servants ~tweetbreak~ The *norm* for humans is to partly migrate and mix at the scale of genetic timescales - human population geneticists expect to see more and more detail as we sequence more living humans and in particular more ancient bones ~tweetbreak~ The ""ethnicity"" concepts are laid on top of this complex genetic mixing a culturally driven way - the labels are not good proxies for genetics and can never really be because genetics is far messier and far more independent areas ~tweetbreak~ Because of this, although the physical aspects of ethnicity have a genetic component, ethnicity is just not a good proxy to genetics. For starters it is just one label for this complex thing but also is just a big mess underneath ~tweetbreak~ Some skeptics - and people who hold hard onto the sense of racial differences - might agree with all of this but then say ""but there are still *some* level of genetic differences between ethnic groups"" and this ""must contribute even if it is just a little bit"" ~tweetbreak~ So - there are genetic differences between people, yes, and formally any grouping of people measured at good enough precision on anything will show differences, but this is true for *any* arbitrary grouping. ~tweetbreak~ I might as well characterise people across the world by the Premier League football club they support, and then measure height, educational attainment, colon cancer genetics..., and there will be differences. But that difference would be arbitrary by classification. ~tweetbreak~ Critically it would not be very useful for me to ask everyone on applications to tick ""which Premier League football club do you support"" with a ""prefer not to say"" box, and then use that inform decisions. Far better to ... assess people directly. ~tweetbreak~ Are ethnic group labels as arbitrary as Premier League football clubs? It's probably a close run thing (for a variety of reasons, Premier League club support is weirdly  hetreogenous worldwide). Both though are not *useful* proxies. ~tweetbreak~ Furthermore, due to the endless mixing of humans (it is really a constant thing), the arbitrary groupings over 50 years ago will just morph into arbitrary groupings now and in the future. Hence ""Cape Coloured"" and ""Black British in Liverpool"". ~tweetbreak~ That the genetics of intelligence is genomewide, not obviously recently selected and that ethnicity labels are crude, broad groupings across complex human history means genetics has a low - if any - contribution to between ethnic group educational differences.",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

In the early days of the pandemic, I saw debate develop between those advocating we listen to experts and those who felt we should listen to the data. This is a false dichotomy, let me say why... ~tweetbreak~ This false dichotomy was concerning to me because analyzing data without scientific expertise is dangerous. Analysis needs to be grounded in real world experience (derived from experiments) of what is plausible. Without this, we can be worse off for having looked at the data. ~tweetbreak~ A lot of people think asking questions of data is a foolproof way of learning more about the world. That as long as your statistics methodology is good and you have high-quality data, you will be smarter after you try to answer a question with data than before. This is not true. ~tweetbreak~ You have to be careful about asking questions of data because badly framed questions can smuggle assumptions into your thought processes that actively make you more wrong than if you never tried to answer those questions at all. ~tweetbreak~ ""What kind of cheese is the moon made of?"" is a bad question that will actively make you stupid. No amount of investigating what cheese most closely matches the properties of the moon will help you here. Good cheese data won't help you. State of the art algorithms won't help you. ~tweetbreak~ The only thing that will help is to reject the question and go back to where you were before you asked it. You need to ask what material is the moon made of? Could it be cheese or something else? This seems obvious but people make this mistake in data analysis all the time. ~tweetbreak~ ""Are covid-19 infection rates affected by racial genetics?"" is potentially one of these kinds of bad questions. In the context of looking at broad patterns between racial populations, it assumes too much. The point here is subtle so let me illustrate. ~tweetbreak~ Is being likely to have spent time in my childhood home genetic? Presumably, my nuclear family has genes specific to us and we all lived there. My relatives have genes that are more like me and they are more likely to have spent time in the house than the general population. ~tweetbreak~ I can promise you that if you get a dataset of people and try to figure out if being closely related to me makes you more likely to have spent time in my family home, you will see a beautiful pattern like my 1st cousins are more likely to be there than 2nd cousins and so on. ~tweetbreak~ This is the genetics version of the cheese question. We assumed that living in the house was genetic and then we are narrowing down the genetic variants that cause it. This model predicts the past data, but it doesn't predict future data because it's not a causal pattern. ~tweetbreak~ If you put those genes in a new person, they won't instinctively wander off in search of my childhood home. This kind of thing is why we need to be careful about looking at patterns in human data and thinking that these patterns automatically mean something is genetic. ~tweetbreak~ We need more evidence outside of just patterns. We need experiments to help us figure out plausible types of causation and we need to be careful about assuming everything that differs between races is genetic. Not only does it needlessly promote racism, it's often bad science. ~tweetbreak~ Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

I work in a legal clinic on wage theft cases, where employers have ""improperly paid"" workers by not paying, paying below min wage, withholding overtime, paid sick time, etc. 1/ ~tweetbreak~ Most theft is wage theft.  Meaning, the dollar value of stolen wages is greater than the value, each year, of all burglaries+robberies, shoplifting, auto theft, combined.  Yet, wage theft is NOT A CRIME 2/ https://t.co/BOj2yXXmtP ~tweetbreak~ If you steal $100 from your employer, you will get arrested.  If you call the police because your paycheck is $100 light, the police will tell you to file a complaint with the AG, and the AG will settle the case for between $50 and $200. 3/ ~tweetbreak~ (That's actually not true, bc AG's only take on big cases with thousands of dollars are stake, but they will settle big cases by typically requiring the employer to properly pay what is owed.  No jail, no criminal record).  4/ ~tweetbreak~ If the AG doesn't want to take the case, it will give you a Private Right of Action to sue the employer in civil court for what you are owed, plus damages.  It can take a 6 to 18 months to win at trial, and months or years to collect on the judgment if you win. 5/ ~tweetbreak~ In short, we address the predominant form of theft in the US with civil court cases, not criminal cases.  We have literally defined ""wage theft"" as not a crime.  Theft by you, a crime. Theft by your employer, not a crime. ~tweetbreak~ This is what we mean when we say crime is ""socially constructed.""  Not all social harms are criminalized.  Not all actors committing social harm are criminalized. ~tweetbreak~ I settled a case for $27K for three clients last year.  We spent a MONTH negotiating the non-disclosure agreement because the employer stated if all his employees sued him and settled like this, he would go BANKRUPT.  His business model DEPENDED on wage theft. 8/ ~tweetbreak~ These employers go on to hold elected office.  45 famously used wage theft to improve his finances on construction projects, leaving a trail of victims in his wake.  Some sued and he had to pay them. Others didn't have resources to pursue multi-year litigation + got nothing. 9/ ~tweetbreak~ What should we do about it? criminalize employers or decriminalize theft or something else? 10/ https://t.co/aKiCq85ZkB ~tweetbreak~ Wage theft shows that we believe restitution is important. Giving the money back is important. Currently, AG keeps track of bad actors and will increase future financial penalties for bad actors. 11/ ~tweetbreak~ It also shows when harm is committed, we don't have to lock someone in a cage or label them a felon, both of which destroy years of life even after the sentence is over. We can demand restitution instead of punishment. 11/ ~tweetbreak~ It also shows how ridiculous the label ""high crime neighborhood"" is. And the arbitrary and racist response of police surveillance in HCN. Because we defined it that way.  

Consider the social construction of murder: 12/ ~tweetbreak~ Poison a person, go to jail, they call you a felon for life. Poison a city resulting in dozens of deaths and thousands with brain damage, get a teaching fellowship at Harvard, they call you ex-Gov of Michigan Rick Snyder.  Same with much corporate poisoning. 13/ ~tweetbreak~ The people commiting the most harm aren't in jail, don't live in high crime neighborhoods.  And ""black people commit more crime"" is true only bc of how we have defined crimes, and how we then surveil their community in response to find more crimes. 14/",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Vid: https://t.co/QnwxAM7krU https://t.co/tCw5stUnMT ~tweetbreak~ First, there's THE ""immortal"" jellyfish: Turritopsis is the size of a bread crumb, and when it's hurt, it curls into a ball and transforms into a younger version of itself. Imagine if are injured and just TURN INTO A LITERAL BABY. Like that.
study: https://t.co/aZk9SXK7Uw https://t.co/ecl9Lb7Dw9 ~tweetbreak~ It does this through a series of very unattractive maneuvers, including transforming into a fleshy little mound and then growing new baby parts out of that mound. It would not be a good look for people. So once it's babied itself...
study: https://t.co/aZk9SXK7Uw https://t.co/zvpxwhgla4 ~tweetbreak~ Turritopsis can start its life over, literally! Most jellyfish lives go like this: Jellies make larvae that grow into little stumpy ""ground jellies"" aka polyps. Polyps make jellyfish, like flowers on a tree...Turritopsis goes from jelly BACK TO POLYP. Here's where it gets WILD... https://t.co/pxynaQ0QQC ~tweetbreak~ Because IT'S NOT JUST TURRITOPSIS. But it must be some other random jelly you've never heard of right? Something living far away? NOPE: MOON JELLYFISH. The famous, see them everywhere MOON JELLYFISH CAN GO BACKWARDS, TOO. And they're not alone...
Study: https://t.co/Rwr6ZL75QL https://t.co/QHvsS3KPUv ~tweetbreak~ In total, I know of AT LEAST four species that can pull this off. All in very different parts of the jellyfish family tree! But how long can they actually live, you ask? Well...

Video: https://t.co/0fhejIUWEU ~tweetbreak~ So We know jellies can reverse their life cycle and live for nearly 100 years and possibly longer. WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED?! I MEAN, that's immortality in a nutshell, right?!??! Well, not quite... 
(p.s. article I wrote on space jellies) https://t.co/cpjPzCkaUX ~tweetbreak~ See, aging and dying are two different things. And I think we can all agree that living forever would really suck if we also aged, too. And it turns out, there are lots of creatures that can *theoretically* still live forever, but still age. Like grass... https://t.co/Fwg69FTa5y ~tweetbreak~ People were all like ""OMG these grass patches have been around for hundreds of years. DO they live forever?!"" And the answer is 'yeah kinda' except that they become more fragile. If you grow 100-year-old grass next to 1-year-old grass under the same stressful conditions... ~tweetbreak~ The older grass will die sooner, it's just not as tough. In other words: it aged. It doesn't seem to have a clear end-of-life timeline, but aging is hard to fight. It just happens to cells as they live their celly life. But what does this have to do with jellies?... ~tweetbreak~ ""Immortal"" jellyfish may age. They may grow old. They may live forever if we can keep them increasingly comfortable, but the ONLY way to know for sure is if we keep them FOREVER. It turns out, fundamentally, that only immortals can truly recognize other immortals. So... ~tweetbreak~ for the rest of us, we can look, wonder, and study. And let the mystery live on, literally.

Well, since it‚Äôs so simple, let‚Äôs find the biological roots, shall we?  Let‚Äôs talk about sex...[a thread] ~tweetbreak~ If you know a bit about biology you will probably say that biological sex is caused by chromosomes, XX and you‚Äôre female, XY and you‚Äôre male. This is ‚Äúchromosomal sex‚Äù but is it ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù? Well... ~tweetbreak~ Turns out there is only ONE GENE on the Y chromosome that really matters to sex. It‚Äôs called the SRY gene. During human embryonic development the SRY protein turns on male-associated genes. Having an SRY gene makes you ‚Äúgenetically male‚Äù. But is this ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù? ~tweetbreak~ Sometimes that SRY gene pops off the Y chromosome and over to an X chromosome. Surprise! So now you‚Äôve got an X with an SRY and a Y without an SRY. What does this mean? ~tweetbreak~ A Y with no SRY means physically you‚Äôre female, chromosomally you‚Äôre male (XY) and genetically you‚Äôre female (no SRY). An X with an SRY means you‚Äôre physically male, chromsomally female (XX) and genetically male (SRY). But biological sex is simple! There must be another answer... ~tweetbreak~ Sex-related genes ultimately turn on hormones in specifics areas on the body, and reception of those hormones by cells throughout the body. Is this the root of ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù?? ~tweetbreak~ ‚ÄúHormonal male‚Äù means you produce ‚Äònormal‚Äô levels of male-associated  hormones. Except some percentage of females will have higher levels of ‚Äòmale‚Äô hormones than some percentage of males. Ditto ditto ‚Äòfemale‚Äô hormones. And... ~tweetbreak~ ...if you‚Äôre developing, your body may not produce enough hormones for your genetic sex. Leading you to be genetically male or female, chromosomally male or female, hormonally non-binary, and physically non-binary. Well, except cells have something to say about this... ~tweetbreak~ Maybe cells are the answer to ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù?? Right??  Cells have receptors that ‚Äúhear‚Äù the signal from sex hormones. But sometimes those receptors don‚Äôt work. Like a mobile phone that‚Äôs on ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äô. Call and cell, they will not answer. ~tweetbreak~ What does this all mean? ~tweetbreak~ It means you may be genetically male or female, chromosomally male or female, hormonally male/female/non-binary, with cells that may or may not hear the male/female/non-binary call, and all this leading to a body that can be male/non-binary/female. ~tweetbreak~ Try out some combinations for yourself. Notice how confusing it gets? Can you point to what the absolute cause of biological sex is? Is it fair to judge people by it? ~tweetbreak~ Of course you could try appealing to the numbers. ‚ÄúMost people are either male or female‚Äù you say. Except that as a biologist professor I will tell you... ~tweetbreak~ The reason I don‚Äôt have my students look at their own chromosome in class is because people could learn that their chromosomal sex doesn‚Äôt match their physical sex, and learning that in the middle of a 10-point assignment is JUST NOT THE TIME. ~tweetbreak~ Biological sex is complicated. Before you discriminate against someone on the basis of ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù &amp; identity, ask yourself: have you seen YOUR chromosomes? Do you know the genes of the people you love? The hormones of the people you work with? The state of their cells? ~tweetbreak~ Since the answer will obviously be no, please be kind, respect people‚Äôs right to tell you who they are, and remember that you don‚Äôt have all the answers.

As a former mathematician, I have things to say.  1/üßµ ~tweetbreak~ Statements like ""2+2 = 4"" are abstractions. What that means is they're generalizations of ""something"". You should always think of these statements as associated with an underlying reality. As a data analyst, I love numbers but It's my job to connect them to reality. 2/ ~tweetbreak~ Literal-minded people might sometimes say things like I put a rooster and hen together and I came back a year later and there were three of them (1+1=3) or they might say I left a fox and a hen together and later I came back and there was only one (1+1=1).  3/ ~tweetbreak~ People like this sound stupid but they are making a tremendously deep point. Our numbers, our quantitative measures, are abstractions of real underlying things in the universe and it's important to keep track of this when we use numbers to model the real world. 4/ ~tweetbreak~ This is a great lesson for a junior data scientist to remember. Whenever you create a numerical construct like IQ or an aggression score or a sentiment score, it's important to remember that properties of this score might not mirror the real things being measured. 5/ ~tweetbreak~ The very act of turning something into a number is an assumption. 6/ ~tweetbreak~ You can think of an arithmetic as coming from entities living in an underlying space. For instance, 2+2 could mean 2 oranges plus 2 oranges. In which case, ""2+2 = 4"" means 4 oranges is the same amount of oranges. 7/ ~tweetbreak~ You can think of an arithmetic as a system of rules like a board game and not think about the underlying space at all. Mathematicians call such systems ""formal"" which means ""I don't care if this stuff really works out, I will apply these rules blindly and hope it makes sense."" 8/ ~tweetbreak~ The reason numbers feel so right is mathematicians have done all the hard work of figuring our how to make calculations track with reality. They kept modifying and refining the number system until everything worked out. It took centuries of brilliant minds to do this! 9/ ~tweetbreak~ At this point, you're probably like ""Kareem, are you for real?"" You probably think you've never encountered a calculation that felt weird or unnatural. You have! I'll prove it. 10/ ~tweetbreak~ One place mathematicians haven't quite figured out how to make things feel as natural is operations around infinity. What is infinity times zero? They just tell you not to do that, right? The reason is because it depends! There is no single answer. 11/ ~tweetbreak~ If you take ""infinity"" to mean a process that's growing very large and ""zero"" as a process that's shrinking, sometimes the shrinking process overtakes the growing one so 0 ‚ãÖ ‚àû = 0. Sometimes it's the other way around  0 ‚ãÖ ‚àû = ‚àû. Sometimes they balance out and 0 ‚ãÖ ‚àû = 12. ~tweetbreak~ Because there's no one thing that always happens, we mostly avoid doing arithmetic with infinity. Doesn't that feel like a bit of a con? They don't have a nice set of rules for it, so they tell you not to do it? That's how it is folks. Math isn't as clean as you think it is. 13/ ~tweetbreak~ The sense that it all works out nicely is a bit of illusion based on thousands of highly intelligent minds working hard to make sure you know where to step without blowing yourself up. Math is logical but it's not always neat and nice. 14/ ~tweetbreak~ My situation is I analyze data all day. I turn reality into numbers. I'm not a mathematician. I don't get to ignore reality. I'm not a layman that can mostly live without playing with math too much. I have to sit on the border between math and reality and make them line up. 15/ ~tweetbreak~ So when somebody tells me ""2+2=5"", I WILL ALWAYS ask them for more details rather than just dismissing them as an idiot because maybe they're talking about chickens and turns out that's how chickens work! üßµ/",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

to start the story, let‚Äôs review how the Sun generates energy. 

the Sun‚Äîand stars in general‚Äîfuse elements in their core. that energy is released in the form of starlight, which we see from earth! ~tweetbreak~ neutrinos are byproducts of the nuclear fusion process taking place in the core of the star. 

they travel to the surface of the star, pass through the outer layers, fly through the interstellar medium, reach the earth, fly through us, and continue on their journey.. ~tweetbreak~ based on the solar luminosity, the distance to the sun, and the amount of energy of each neutrino, we can calculate the expected neutrino flux from the sun. 

in other words, we can estimate the number of particles/second/cm^2 we should see. 

and the answer shocked scientists. ~tweetbreak~ to measure the neutrino flux, scientists build HUGE underground detectors. 

because the interaction cross section of neutrinos is SO small, we‚Äôd need a HUGE detector to get a high enough interaction rate. ~tweetbreak~ detectors are filled with water etc bc ùòµùò©ùò¶ ùò¥ùò±ùò¶ùò¶ùò• ùò∞ùòß ùò≠ùò™ùò®ùò©ùòµ ùò™ùòØ ùò¢ ùòÆùò¶ùò•ùò™ùò∂ùòÆ ùò≠ùò™ùò¨ùò¶ ùò∏ùò¢ùòµùò¶ùò≥ &lt; ùòµùò©ùò¶ ùò¥ùò±ùò¶ùò¶ùò• ùò∞ùòß ùò≠ùò™ùò®ùò©ùòµ ùò™ùòØ ùò¢ ùò∑ùò¢ùò§ùò∂ùò∂ùòÆ.

when the neutrinos interact with the chlorine, they produce an isotope of radioactive argon. then it gets removed from the tank.. ~tweetbreak~ scientists wait to watch the argon decay into other electrons, which is the signal we‚Äôre looking for!! 

great. so. we‚Äôve measured our neutrinos. now what? ~tweetbreak~ here‚Äôs the problem. the measured values of the neutrinos were 1/3 of what theory predicted. 

live view of scientists at the time: https://t.co/omC7JJectu ~tweetbreak~ so scientists did what all good scientists do, and did follow-up experiments on detectors like the Soviet-American Gallium Experiment and Super Kamiokande. 

they all measured a deficit of 1/3 of the expected value of neutrinos. ~tweetbreak~ SO. either the sun is producing far fewer neutrinos than expected, or neutrinos are somehow getting lost on their way to earth. ~tweetbreak~ enter the Sudbury Neutrino observatory, a 1,000 ton detector 7,000 feet underground. 

now this detector is a little different. it uses heavy water D‚ÇÇO. why does that make a difference..? https://t.co/eaciYqrwF0 ~tweetbreak~ WELL‚Äî and here‚Äôs what‚Äôs cool‚Äî the heavy water can separate neutrinos into their three distinct flavors:

ùó∫ùòÇùóºùóª. ùó≤ùóπùó≤ùó∞ùòÅùóøùóºùóª. ùòÅùóÆùòÇ. ~tweetbreak~ the electron neutrino is detected via a charged current. 

muon and tau neutrinos are detected via elastic scattering by bouncing off electrons. 

finally, neutral current allows the neutrino to break up a D‚ÇÇO molecule. this works for ALL neutrino flavors. ~tweetbreak~ and we finally figured it out...

the ùóßùó¢ùóßùóîùóü number of neutrinos agreed with theory. 

the number of ùó≤ùóπùó≤ùó∞ùòÅùóøùóºùóª neutrinos is 1/3 of the total.

which means.. neutrinos from the Sun ùóñùóõùóîùó°ùóöùóò ùóôùóüùóîùó©ùó¢ùó•ùó¶ en route to earth, morphing into each other. ~tweetbreak~ even weirder: the Standard Model of physics‚Äî the theory of fundamental particles and how they interact‚Äî predicts that neutrinos should be massless.  

but for this neutrino oscillation to happen, they must have SOME very little mass. ~tweetbreak~ which means we learn two things:

1) neutrinos oscillate into different flavors (muon, electron, tau) as they fly through interstellar space

2) the Standard Model is wrong. neutrinos must have mass. ~tweetbreak~ this discovery revolutionized particle physics, earning the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics. clearly there is physics behind the Standard Model..and we‚Äôre just at the beginning to learn what that‚Äôs like.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

A short history thread. 1/ https://t.co/hby7lCmN2b ~tweetbreak~ Robert Williams, a Black psychologist, came up with the name ""Ebonics"" in the 70s by combining Ebony and linguistics. Before that, our vernacular was widely known as ""nonstandard Negro English"" which puts us at a deviation from English, as opposed to Ebonics, our own dialect. ~tweetbreak~ Educators has been studying how we spoke for decades and in the 80s and 90s teachers finally realized we were putting too many Black kids in special ed classes simply because of how we spoke at home and we should be doing what Norway was doing. ~tweetbreak~ Norway has a lot of dialects. If a kid came in speaking a (making this name up) Crystal dialect, the teacher would say ""that's how you speak at home using these rules, and this is how those rules translate into standard Norweigian."" They would use Crystal as a springboard. ~tweetbreak~ In the US, we didn't do that. If you spoke Ebonics, your teacher would basically go ""that's wrong, don't say that"" and punish you OR you would score lower on IQ tests because no one had taught you how English relates to Ebonics. ~tweetbreak~ Oakland says ""hmm...why don't we give our teachers the tools to understand Ebonics so when kids come in speaking it, they can relate the rules of Ebonics to the rules of standard English so the kids will speak both and score better on tests."" ~tweetbreak~ WHITE AMERICA THREW A FIT and tens of thousands of news stories in the mid 90s said that Oakland was trying to teach kids Ebonics. Liberal and Conservative publications both trashed Oakland's idea and Ebonics became a bad word. ~tweetbreak~ No one was paying attention to what Oakland actually proposed -- which is taking kids who ALREADY KNOW EBONICS (so why would we have to teach them?) and relating English rules to those rules so they could switch more effectively and do better in school. ~tweetbreak~ A head start group famously ran this image of a MLK-like figure in the New York Times to protest Ebonics. Notably, this is INCORRECT Ebonics anyway, as this subject/verb agreement is not one found in the way we speak -- another instance of white people outside of their lane. https://t.co/XoalPfanq5 ~tweetbreak~ That's why ""Ebonics"" sounds like a bad word to a lot of people. White America had another knee-jerk reaction to a perceived threat to white supremacy, this time in the form of our language being ""taught"" in schools, and did everything they could to stamp it out. ~tweetbreak~ Congress got involved and went so far as to threaten Oakland with pulling federal funds if they even proposed anything close to ""teaching"" Ebonics.

And now we say AAVE because white people got scared of Ebonics in 1996 and we're still dealing with it. /end ~tweetbreak~ I just re-read this thread and realized I put ""ebony"" and ""linguistics"" but I meant to type ""phonics.""

Because the detections made it look like a very high energy particle (the elusive neutrino) traveled through the entire Earth. BUT, neutrinos with this much energy aren't expected to do this, they should crash into things along the way

Here's my answer as a scholar who writes about black musicians in Europe for a living:

1/? ~tweetbreak~ Surprise! I can't answer that question yet. I haven't had time to go through original German sources and read them for myself. But I can tell you that the question, ""Was Beethoven Black?"" has been around since the 1930s, when African American journalists began to circulate it. https://t.co/roDIToa196 ~tweetbreak~ The question, ""Was Beethoven Black"" got picked up again  in the 1960s by Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael. See Michael Broyles's book, Beethoven in America.  They wanted to associate blackness with genius, which white people constantly denied.¬†

https://t.co/BygrBFN8jH ~tweetbreak~ But to my mind, Beethoven being black is a red herring. We don't need him to prove our genius. But do you know a figure who was Black during Beethoven's day? ~tweetbreak~ Violinist George Bridgetower (1791-1860).¬†The son of an Afro-Caribbean servant and a Polish mother at the Esterhazy palace, he was a student of composer Joseph Haydn and a friend of Beethoven. Beethoven dedicated a violin sonata to him, which was so hard to play many gave up. https://t.co/TEwoMp6rcr ~tweetbreak~ The African American musicologist Maud Cuney Hare first championed George Bridgetower in 1927, the centenary of Beethoven's death. She noticed that white musicologists only talked about Beethoven‚Äînot Bridgetower. https://t.co/n433UFBwxr ~tweetbreak~ So instead of asking the question, ""Was Beethoven Black?"" ask ""Why don't I know anything about George Bridgetower?"" I, frankly, don't need any more debates about Beethoven's blackness. But I do need people to play the music of Bridgetower. And others like him. ~tweetbreak~ There are already many Black European composers whose music deserves our ears. Chevalier de St. George. Samuel Coleridge Taylor. Edmond D√©d√©. Amanda Aldridge.

This thread will explain the large, dark clumps jelly with your period. It might be surprising to see a thick glob of menstrual blood, but, in most cases, blood clots are a natural part of menstruation. (Spongebob Edition) https://t.co/YZOkADa1Bp ~tweetbreak~ Clots are the natural result of your body taking care of you. Clots are a natural way of controlling bleeding. They can appear like clumps, chunks, and/or a jelly-like consistency and can vary in size and number. https://t.co/5RXyOgSfHs ~tweetbreak~ Menstrual clots are gel-like blobs of coagulated blood, tissue, and blood that are expelled from the uterus during menstruation. Most menstruators will experience menstrual clots at some point in their lives. https://t.co/3bIXxMPBeN ~tweetbreak~ What causes Menstrual Clots? During menstruation, the endometrial cells that line the uterus strip away and leave the body. As this happens, the body releases proteins that cause the blood in the uterus to coagulate. https://t.co/lDK2cS0HWn ~tweetbreak~ This coagulation prevents the blood vessels in the uterine lining from continuing to bleed. The coagulation proteins within the blood may start to clump together, resulting in menstrual clots. ~tweetbreak~ In other words: Menstrual blood clots are a natural part of the body's defense mechanism. The thick, jelly-like texture of a menstrual clot helps prevent too much blood from escaping. https://t.co/xJpVtbONbt ~tweetbreak~ I repeat this again: Period clots are nothing to worry about (really), and they tend to come with heavy-ish periods. Period clots are not a sign that there is something wrong unless the following happens: https://t.co/TOVR5a1n3d ~tweetbreak~ If the clots are small, no larger than a R2 coin, and only occasional, they‚Äôre usually nothing to worry about. HOWEVER, if you experience regular passing large clots, then you need to cut the cameras and see your doctor. https://t.co/QpDZjqXKjj ~tweetbreak~ If you experience heavy periods with large blood clots that leave you feeling light-headed - see your doctor. You should also consult your doctor if you notice a sudden change in your period, or if you‚Äôre experiencing overall discomfort. https://t.co/zVg6Ihp2qa ~tweetbreak~ Menstrual clots are a normal part of a menstruators life.

A thread. 

1/12 https://t.co/oVaUVr1UAe ~tweetbreak~ It's true, #rocket #leaves are hyperaccumulators of #nitrates ; this isn't anything new. It's been known for a long time. Other crops with high nitrate content include #spinach and #watercress

2/12 https://t.co/Bc4Ob30ftD ~tweetbreak~ Nitrate content varies according to where the #crop is grown, and is closely tied to the soil #plants are grown in, and the amount of #light they receive. Rocket leaves grown in #winter have higher nitrate content than those grown in #summer

3/12 https://t.co/yG4xQSgzu3 ~tweetbreak~ The #EU introduced in regulation No. 1881/2006 to impose 'limits' on nitrate in rocket. These values were completely arbitrary, and not based on any #scientific #clinical data. The 'limits' for spinach, are half that of rocket, yet both can contain similar amounts.

4/12 https://t.co/BssK5LIQwo ~tweetbreak~ Nitrates are thought to react with acid in the stomach to produce nitrosamines. It is these products which are thought to be #carcinogenic

No human studies have ever conclusively proved this to be the case.

5/12 https://t.co/9hfHnp04oQ ~tweetbreak~ The body of #evidence arguably lies with the opposite #hypothesis ; that nitrate is beneficial for human #health

E.g. Some studies related to #sports #nutrition have found beneficial effects in athletes who consume nitrate-rich #vegetables

This study specifically used rocket 

7/12 https://t.co/aRqyVGuuql ~tweetbreak~ There are even reported beneficial effects for smokers who consume more nitrate:

8/12 https://t.co/dUFmmxYLGG ~tweetbreak~ The tabloid #article also completely missed the fact that rocket produces other #phytochemicals that have been linked with positive health effects, such as #isothiocyanates and #flavonols

9/12 https://t.co/xkX4IMBQBr ~tweetbreak~ My own and @cwagstaff 's research has shown that the isothiocyanate #sulforaphane (linked with anti-cancer effects; specifically prostate cancer) is stable or even increases in rocket leaves #postharvest

So, let's imagine I'm a business owner and you come to me looking for a job. 

We talk about your the terms of your employment and eventually we come to the big question: ~tweetbreak~ How much you'll get paid. 

After some chatter, we agree on $10 an hour (for simplicity's sake). 

Now, I want you to think about this: 

When you come and work for me, through your labour you're going to be producing a certain amount of value every hour. ~tweetbreak~ Now here's the thing about this. 

We agreed that I'll pay you $10 an hour.

Now, if you are creating $10 an hour in value for the business, I'm breaking even on cost and I don't have an incentive to hire you - it makes no difference ~tweetbreak~ If you're creating LESS than $10 an hour in value through your labour, well then I'm losing money on you and am actively disincentivised from hiring you. 

BUT, if you're creating more than $10 an hour in value for me (say $15 an hour), but I'm only paying you... ~tweetbreak~ ...$10, where that other $5 going? 

That $5 is called ""surplus value"", or as you'll probably know it as: 

""Profit""

Now, if you're producing $15 an hour for me and I'm returning you $10, well then I'm making $5 an hour off of you and I definitely want to hire you. ~tweetbreak~ That means that if you're giving away 1/3 of what you produce through your labour every hour, you're working at least 20 minutes of every hour FOR FREE. 

You add that up after an 8 hour day, and  for 2hrs 40mins of that day you've PAID ME to work for me. ~tweetbreak~ Now, say I don't have one employee. Say I have five. All producing $15/hr, all being paid $10/hr

At the end of the day, I'm walking home with $200 (5x8=40, 40x5=200), and each of my employees are going home with $80. ~tweetbreak~ If you work for me for three years, that means that you have spent an entire year of your life working for me, not just for free, but PAYING ME to work FOR ME. ~tweetbreak~ All business owners do this, but some on a much larger scale than others. 

Jeff Bezos has done this thousands of times over to thousands of people. 

Remember that machinery improves productivity so each worker could be producing FAR more than they're being paid. ~tweetbreak~ This is why Jeff Bezos did not ""earn"" his money - he took it 

This is why he's not being generous by hiring people - it's in his interest more than anyone elses in that relationship to hire someone.

He hasn't ""given"" his workers a job - they've given him their surplus value. ~tweetbreak~ These rich bastards who run the media, who run our world, want you to think they ""earned"" their wealth so that you don't think their position is unjust - but it is. It's based on robbery of workers. ~tweetbreak~ ""He took the initial risk in setting up the business - it's OK for him to profit because he took that gamble.""

Would it be ethical to profit off of sweatshop labour because I took the risk and invested to set it up? ~tweetbreak~ What about profiting off of a slave plantation? Once upon a time folks had to gamble an investment to set that up - but today we all agree the inherent structure of slavery was unjust and wrong. 

The same applies today to capitalist enterprises. ~tweetbreak~ Taking the initial gamble does not justify then doing horrible things after it.

The Ida B. Wells Homes were the first to be built in a Black community and didn't come along until 1941. ~tweetbreak~ Some people at the CHA were like ""hey we could use this public housing thing to promote integration! everybody needs housing!""

let's guess how that worked out! ~tweetbreak~ The CHA moved eight black families into the Fernwood Homes, an 87-unit housing project intended for veterans. A couple thousand of their white neighbors rioted for four nights. Required a thousand police officers to end it. 

[snippets from the Defender, August 23, 1947] https://t.co/a0HtcT0vkZ ~tweetbreak~ 1953, Betty Howard, a lightskin Black woman, goes to the CHA to apply for housing. The clerk mistakes her for White and puts her in Trumbull Park. When their White neighbors saw them, they set fires and threw bricks at people for several days. The family was trapped in the house. https://t.co/N93QQI5Uv2 ~tweetbreak~ Policy also played a role too, to be sure. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes* established the ""neighborhood composition rule"" that said the racial makeup of public housing had to match its surrounding neighborhood, reifying segregation.

*Chicagoans will find this ironic ~tweetbreak~ Throughout the 1950s, whenever the CHA presented proposed construction sites for new public housing, the City Council nixed the ones that would have been in White neighborhoods. In the ruling in the 1966 Gautreaux case, the judge said: ~tweetbreak~ ‚ÄúIt is incredible that this dismal prospect of an all-Negro public housing system in all-Negro areas came about without the persistent application of a deliberate policy to confine public housing to all Negro or immediately adjacent changing areas‚Ä¶. ~tweetbreak~ No criterion, other than race, can plausibly explain the veto of over 99 1/2% of the housing units located on the White sites which were initially selected on the basis of CHA's expert judgment and at the same time the rejection of only 10% or so of the units on Negro sites.‚Äù ~tweetbreak~ The Gautreaux case was a class action lawsuit claiming that the CHA was racially discriminating, which it clearly was. The idea was to get them to go back to building public housing everywhere, for everyone. ~tweetbreak~ In a consent decree after Gautreaux, instead of bringing back the idea of using public housing to maybe desegregate the city and provide a public good for *everyone* the remediation was that some Black CHA families got vouchers to go live in the suburbs or in nice apartments -__- ~tweetbreak~ People's current attitudes toward public housing, which carry a racial and class stigma, hurt everyone. 

They hurt the mostly low-income Black people (often elderly and/or disabled) who live in public housing, who deserve dignity and respect (why does this need to be said?!). ~tweetbreak~ Beyond harming the people who live in public housing-- racism, contempt, and stigma toward public housing hurts our whole society, because people turn their noses up at something that WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL RIGHT ABOUT NOW if we valued it more highly 

[looks around at pandemic?!] ~tweetbreak~ If you want to learn more about this history, you can read it in my book Ghosts in the Schoolyard, or I highly recommend the book Blueprint for Disaster by Bradford Hunt. ~tweetbreak~ [could write a subthread about how the Gautreaux consent decree, by giving individual families the chance to ""win"" vouchers for the private market rather than providing high-quality housing for all, is an important benchmark for the neoliberal era to follow. but, bedtime!] ~tweetbreak~ ...moving to the voucher system where low-income people have to find housing on their own in the private market leaves them subject to widespread discrimination that usually goes unpunished. 

https://t.co/qJpKQ8PVi8 ~tweetbreak~ In theory vouchers could erode Chicago's housing segregation by providing low-income Black people the means to move into majority White neighborhoods, but it doesn't work that way because landlords discriminate, as @natalieymoore writes. 

https://t.co/P8sPsK5OAT ~tweetbreak~ ""It's a stigma attached to Section 8 that we don't want to work, we're nasty, we're not educated, we don't take care of ourselves, our children are just reckless."" 

imho this kind of stigma is sadly often internalized by Black people as well, even other low-income Black people. ~tweetbreak~ k i'm done now, goodnight for real, let's all try not to be disrespectful racist classist jerks",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Banks are a critical feature of the modern economy. But most people don't understand how modern banking actually works.

Spoiler Alert: It may shock you.

Here's Banking 101!

üëáüëáüëá https://t.co/M5XGedwtWS ~tweetbreak~ 1/ First, a bit of history.

Most historians believe the earliest forms of banking began to appear around ~2000 BC in ancient India, Assyria, and Sumeria.

Ancient Greece and Rome expanded upon this legacy.

But banking transitioned into its more modern form in Renaissance Italy. https://t.co/OyqmqCDP5t ~tweetbreak~ 2/ In its most basic sense, the business of banking is very simple.

Take money from depositors (deposits), pay them interest. Lend money to borrowers (using deposits), receive interest.

As long as the interest received exceeds the interest paid, the bank is happy / profitable. ~tweetbreak~ 3/ Historically, banks would maintain sufficient ""reserves"" (cash/metals) to give depositors their money back on request.

This is prudent, but limits the ability to create credit and thus may stifle investment in an economy.

So called ""fractional reserve banking"" changed that. ~tweetbreak~ 4/ Fractional reserve banking allows banks to only maintain a fraction of deposits in their reserves.

If the reserve requirement is 10%, a bank with $100 in deposits only has to maintain $10 in reserves.

To illustrate the beauty (and the beast!) of this system, here's a story. ~tweetbreak~ 5/ Imagine you arrive in a new town in California during the gold rush.

You get off the train with $1,000 in your pocket (and boundless ambition!).

You head over to the new CA Savings Bank and deposit the money into a bank account.

You are happy. https://t.co/UHyDzw9u48 ~tweetbreak~ 6/ CA Savings has a 10% reserve ratio, meaning it has to maintain 10% of your deposit in its reserves.

It places $100 in its reserves and lends the remaining $900 to Judson Adam, who uses it to buy gold pans.

The gold pan seller, Josiah Smith, deposits the $900 into CA Savings. ~tweetbreak~ 7/ CA Savings places $90 (10% of $900) in reserves and lends the remaining $810 to Jeremiah Black, who uses it to buy wheelbarrows.

The wheelbarrow seller, Johnson Campbell, decides to keep the cash in his pocket.

Let's take a step back and look at what has happened here. ~tweetbreak~ 8/ Your original deposit of $1,000 at CA Savings started this chain, but there is now $2,710 of ""cash"" in circulation.

You: $1,000 at CA Savings
Josiah: $900 at CA Savings
Johnson: $810 in pocket

The fractional reserve banking model enabled the creation of credit/dollars. ~tweetbreak~ 9/ That is mostly a good thing.

Judson and Jeremiah received loans that allowed them to spend, invest in equipment, start businesses, hire, etc.

The fractional reserve system enabled credit creation, which in turn sparked growth.

So that is the beauty.

What about the beast? ~tweetbreak~ 10/ Say there is an earthquake. You get nervous, so you ask CA Savings for your $1,000 back.

Well, they only have $190 of it (10% reserves from the $1,900 in deposits received).

They have to call in their loans (and halt any new lending) to meet your withdrawal.

This is bad. ~tweetbreak~ 11/ If the bank is unable to call its loans to meet withdrawals, it may be insolvent. Panic ensues. Credit contracts. The economy slumps.

The system can quickly unravel.

This is a highly simplified example - closed system, very few depositors and loans - but the basics hold. ~tweetbreak~ 12/ So you see, the modern fractional reserve banking system is both beauty and beast.

It enables the creation of credit, which may drive investment and growth.

But it also opens the door to rapid contractions, which tend to be self-fulfilling as panic begets more panic. ~tweetbreak~ 13/ I was inspired to do this primer after reading a great thread from @coloradotravis. As he points out, the system relies on banks actually lending. If they aren't lending, dollars are dying.

Thanks to @RaoulGMI @SantiagoAuFund for sharing it!

It's impossible to explain how bitcoin works without first understanding what a Hash is.

If you'd like to expand your background knowledge, read on üëá ~tweetbreak~ Hashes are used for all kinds of things, but a simple analogy is to think of them like fingerprints for data. https://t.co/CQywn8n6jf ~tweetbreak~ You can think of a Hash Function like a magic fingerprint reader. You can enter any data into the hash function, and it will spit out a fingerprint. https://t.co/AeY1Jop2KB ~tweetbreak~ Anything can be used as a Hash Function, but a good hash function will ensure that different input data will each have unique fingerprints.

One of the most common Hash Functions used today is called SHA-256, which stands for ""Secure Hash Algorithm, 256 bits"" ~tweetbreak~ Check out the link below. Try entering your name and see what the Hash Function spits out

Notice that no matter how much or little data you enter, the resulting hash is always different

https://t.co/8yBYPCVm79 ~tweetbreak~ Here's what happens when I type in my name. Notice that if you type in ""Danny"" as well, you'll get the exact same result. This is the SHA-256 hash (or ""fingerprint"") of my name. https://t.co/5ZYt8OWeYI ~tweetbreak~ But what is this SHA-256 voodoo anyway? How is it calculating that fingerprint?

Basically, it does some fancy math on the input data. 

If you're curious, you can look at the details here:

https://t.co/3gqDo6E5O8 ~tweetbreak~ This fancy math guarantees a couple things:

1) Every fingerprint is very likely to be unique

2) If I give you just a fingerprint, you have no way of guessing what the input data was

This second point actually begins to erode the ""fingerprint"" analogy, but its very important. ~tweetbreak~ To explain further, here's an example question...

What is the input data who's SHA-256 hash is:

04a474a12bad5d61e9d461945e6785e28b8789c591efc33a75621a2e65183393 ~tweetbreak~ Any guesses?

Didn't think so! According to what we know about math, it's impossible to figure out the answer to this question without just brute force guessing. https://t.co/o2SlHRRPZ8 ~tweetbreak~ So go ahead, start guessing! The input data could be anything. Maybe its the letter ""A"", or maybe its the entire text from the 3rd Harry Potter book. 

You'll never know unless you guess... or if I tell you... https://t.co/4om5LsfVsZ ~tweetbreak~ The answer is ""Bitcoin is freedom""

Go ahead and run that through the hash function to verify I'm telling the truth! https://t.co/tOD8ZGQtnJ ~tweetbreak~ Ok great, so we can play silly games with Hash functions, but what else can we do?

Well hashes are used for all kinds of things in computer science. 

One common use case is storing passwords! https://t.co/D6QmyFSnqa ~tweetbreak~ Imagine if a website just stored your password, in plain text, in their database. 

Any employee could easily see all the passwords. And if any attacker got access to the database, they'd get them all too!

Bad security!

Instead, websites store the *hashes* of passwords https://t.co/vBDFROI7x7 ~tweetbreak~ When you login, the website takes your password and hashes it, then compares it to the hash that's stored in their database...

If it matches, you're good to go... https://t.co/gO1kc2sD5l ~tweetbreak~ Ever wonder why the ""Forgot my password"" always makes you create a new password (instead of just telling you what your old one was)?

It's because the website doesn't know what your old password was!

They only have the Hash. They have no way of figuring out what the original was ~tweetbreak~ Great so Hashes are neat and useful, but how do they relate to #Bitcoin? ..... https://t.co/QEs0Poy1Zi ~tweetbreak~ In Bitcoin, the SHA-256 function plays a key role in addresses, address scripts, and mining.

I won't go into all the details here, but I will finish with one more game that will begin to explain the mechanics of how Bitcoin uses hashes in its mining system... https://t.co/LayS4WT8fu ~tweetbreak~ Ok here's the game...

I want you to come up with some data that starts with the word ""Bitcoin"", and SHA-256 hashes to something that begins with 000.

First person to come up with an answer wins a reward. https://t.co/b2KPTTpiBk ~tweetbreak~ What's your strategy?

Well, remember that there's no way to start with the Hash and figure out the input data.... 

The only way is to brute force guess the input data!! https://t.co/QSjRVppZn6 ~tweetbreak~ We'll brute force it like this:

Calculate the hash of ""Bitcoin-1"" and see if it starts with 000.

Calculate the hash of ""Bitcoin-2"" and see if it starts with 000.

Then try ""Bitcoin-3"", ""Bitcoin-4"", etc.

The only way is to keep trying and checking until you find one! https://t.co/efue2OzcIp ~tweetbreak~ Eventually if you keep up this process, you'll come across the number 1918, and check it out!

""Bitcoin-1918"" hashes to 00007eb7d15a7f52aabb6bece4b1b3be3e606cc93d020c6f703bf7ff9bd2ac9e, which starts with '000' !! https://t.co/jEX5xUBt1m ~tweetbreak~ How did I find that out? Well, I just wrote a simple script that does that same brute force process.

Try one number, check it, move on to the next, try it, etc... until you find a winner... https://t.co/nPzaeia7nh ~tweetbreak~ In fact, what I've done is I ""Proved"" to you that my computer did some ""Work""... 

Does ""Proof of Work"" sound familiar? https://t.co/gmxL6ax5mB ~tweetbreak~ Just edit our little game and replace the starting word ""Bitcoin"" with a list of bitcoin transactions thats basically how the bitcoin mining competition works! https://t.co/sU5Bg4IGh0 ~tweetbreak~ Miners are all trying to find a list of valid of transactions that Hash to something with a bunch of leadings 0s

And when one of them finds a valid one, they get to add a block to the blockchain and claim a big reward https://t.co/XqeS9rhUoH ~tweetbreak~ Anyway, that's the basics, and I'll end the thread on Hash Functions here.

https://t.co/KdLxLM8QCJ ~tweetbreak~ 2/Pretty much everything about the in-person college experience is a COVID risk.

Parties and campus social activities are some of the highest-risk activities. Simply living in dorms is a pretty big risk. In-person classes are somewhat of a risk as well. https://t.co/runbj0cdLO ~tweetbreak~ 3/A study from South Korea suggests that college-age people are the fastest spreaders of COVID.

https://t.co/kaoqCv5p5p ~tweetbreak~ 4/Death rates are low for young people, but a lot of them get scary long-term symptoms. (And they can spread it to older people who die.)

https://t.co/C5ODFuZ9jl ~tweetbreak~ 5/But empty dorms lose money. So many colleges are preparing to pack the dorms, out of concern for their pocketbooks, even though this will probably cause a lot of illness.

https://t.co/ltHetXOdtR ~tweetbreak~ 6/Like so much of America, they're facing what they think is a short-term choice between money and health, and they're choosing money.

https://t.co/GvgQWIAvIJ ~tweetbreak~ 7/Many are choosing to hold in-person classes, too.

1. https://t.co/Y8STIAUTO6

2. https://t.co/GTyzXKnOYu ~tweetbreak~ 8/Note that Trump and ICE are helping to force their hand, by threatening to bar colleges' highest-paying students (international students) from entering the country if classes are held online.

https://t.co/qMdztWWHUy ~tweetbreak~ 9/Another likely reason colleges are going ahead with on-campus student life and in-person classes is that they're afraid that too much distant learning will cause students to wonder why they're paying so much for ""Zoom University"".

https://t.co/rPrfhzUXlC ~tweetbreak~ 10/My colleague @tylercowen believes that online classes could spark the beginning of a long-term shift away from the traditional college model of education.

I'm skeptical, but it's probably something that's on university administrators' minds.

https://t.co/FGZk4ACxxn ~tweetbreak~ 11/So colleges are choosing $$$ over health in the short term. But in the long term they may lose both. Having a lot of kids get sick will reduce parents' trust in universities as stewards of their children's safety. That could accelerate any shift away from traditional college. ~tweetbreak~ 12/When you add this to a big drop in international students and (probably) a big drop in state funding, it means colleges are in big financial trouble for the forseeable future.

https://t.co/DhX5HQgnH5 ~tweetbreak~ 13/And that means college towns are in big trouble too.

Remember, colleges do a LOT to spur economic growth, especially through research activities that draw in private business.

https://t.co/fx5BO43j38 ~tweetbreak~ 15/Small towns in declining regions often depend on the revenue that colleges bring in, from international students and the government.

That's in jeopardy now. Expect more regions to sink into decline.

https://t.co/Z5K13ODezW ~tweetbreak~ 16/The only real solution to colleges' woes would be a big federal bailout, but with Republicans in charge, that ain't happening. https://t.co/OPraSZ4FW5 ~tweetbreak~ 17/So no matter what colleges do about COVID, they're trapped between a rock and a hard place.

This excellent paper by @ElainePelley &amp; @Molly_Carnes explores the trend of ‚¨ÜÔ∏ègender segregation in medical specialties and downstream impacts.

#WomenInMedicine THREAD
https://t.co/1fBJ9Nyh3W ~tweetbreak~ Women have moved into medicine in huge numbers over the past 4 decades. This is usually viewed as a good news story of social progress in a profession that had either banned or severely restricted female entry well into the 1960‚Äôs. ~tweetbreak~ The authors begin with a discussion on gender segregation in the broader workforce (in the US). It generally decreased thought the 20th C with the entry of women into the workplace, but then stalled in the mid-90‚Äôs and ticked back upwards slightly. ~tweetbreak~ When a large number of women enter a previously male dominated occupation, it will quickly move towards female predominance. This phenomenon is known as ‚Äútipping‚Äù and it has NOT been shown to happen in reverse (ie, men don‚Äôt tend to take over fields seen as ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work‚Äù). ~tweetbreak~ When an occupation hits the gender tipping point (which varies roughly from 13-45% female), entry of men rapidly declines. This is the pattern demonstrated by teachers, secretaries, bank tellers, etc. ~tweetbreak~ In academia and professions requiring high educational attainment, a tipping phenomenon occurs at 24% female. In other words, once a field is ¬º female, men start to lose interest in it. It loses prestige and the ineffable qualities granted by gender exclusivity. ~tweetbreak~ What‚Äôs the evidence that a field loses prestige with female entry? At around the 38% female mark, interest from BOTH men AND women starts to decline. Research also shows an inverse relationship between how challenging a field seems and how many female PhDs are in it. ~tweetbreak~ And this is where we need to talk about the #GenderPayGap. Because not only do female dominated occupations earn less than male dominated occupations, historical data shows that each 10% increase in female share results in a 0.5-5% decline in earnings. ~tweetbreak~ The #GenderPayGap is at it‚Äôs simplest about paying women less for equal work. But the gendering of occupations plays a MAJOR (and often overlooked) role. Research on high skill occupations shows men essentially take a pay cut when they enter female dominated professions. ~tweetbreak~ This bring us to medicine. A profession with DRAMATIC gender segregation among its specialties and little-to-no introspection on the impact of this phenomenon. In Canada, female representation among medical specialties varies from roughly 10% to 75%. ~tweetbreak~ Historically, once women were allowed into medical school, they were immediately shunted into the specialties that seemed appropriate. Ones that involved babies or so-called ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù like counseling. They were strongly discouraged from entering macho fields like surgery. ~tweetbreak~ I say ‚Äúhistorically‚Äù but of course, these ideas remain as strong as ever (that‚Äôs what happens when your industry lacks introspection on its own subculture). 

Ask any woman in medicine and she will tell you LOTS of stories like this one.üëá https://t.co/lUCjemV6Yv ~tweetbreak~ Naturally, we lack data on the gender segregation of specialties over time. If you can‚Äôt SEE a phenomenon, you can‚Äôt study it, right? Fortunately, this paper digs into historical data, showing that US gender segregation in medical specialties has remained static since the 80‚Äôs. ~tweetbreak~ The 80‚Äôs. That‚Äôs my entire lifetime. American medicine has remained frozen in the same sexist ideas about women and men‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural‚Äù skills since the Reagan years. 

Is Canadian medicine any better? We haven‚Äôt analyzed historical data (yet), but I think you know what I would say. https://t.co/3pSCdMVBuQ ~tweetbreak~ Getting back to the #GenderPayGap, this paper does what few have ‚Äì it looks at how feminization of a specialty impacts its relative earnings over time. This is such an important analysis and I can‚Äôt believe we don‚Äôt have more like these. ~tweetbreak~ For example, pediatrics went from 22% to 63% female since 1975, but orthopedics has remained nearly the same. Subsequently, pediatrics went from earning 93% of the average MD salary to 71%. Meanwhile orthopedics went from 160% to 180% of average. ~tweetbreak~ Want a more apples to apples comparison? Let‚Äôs look at OB &amp; urology: OB has lost relative income since the 70‚Äôs while going from 8% to 57% female. Meanwhile, urology has maintained its relative earnings (125% of average MD salary) while remaining at &gt;90% male. ~tweetbreak~ While I haven‚Äôt looked at historical data in Canadian medicine, I have done a lot of work analyzing the gender breakdown in specialties and their relative incomes. Those results will be published next month, but let me summarize it quickly now: ~tweetbreak~ Gender segregation in Canadian medical specialties is a MAJOR factor in the #GenderPayGap. There are many other relevant factors at play, but the shunting of women into ‚Äúfemale-friendly‚Äù specialties while discouraging entry into male dominated specialties plays a huge role. ~tweetbreak~ There‚Äôs tons more to discuss, but this thread is way too long. We need more discussion on how women entering a field devalues it. We also need to broaden this analysis to include ALL of health care, which is full of women doing vitally important &amp; shamefully underpaid work.

Today is the day of presidential election in my native Belarus. It is the 6th election in Belarusian history. Only 1994 election was deemed free and fair, and votes in 2001, 2006, 2010 and 2015 were marred by electoral fraud and government repression.

Belarus deserves a better future than the one offered by the current repressive state built by Lukashenka in the past 26 years.

20/20 https://t","THREAD.

Today is the day of presidential election in my native Belarus. It is the 6th election in Belarusian history. Only 1994 election was deemed free and fair, and votes in 2001, 2006, 2010 and 2015 were marred by electoral fraud and government repression. 

1/x https://t.co/kboXUgGjHW ~tweetbreak~ When the election was announced in early May 2020, it was expected that they would closely resemble the vote of 2015. During which Lukashenka, in power in Belarus since 1994, ran against the crowd of extras who did not really present any threats to him. 

2/x https://t.co/FFdi53IVMl ~tweetbreak~ It quickly emerged that Lukashenka would be challenged from an unexpected front. Not by the the established opposition, mostly confined to identity politics, but by new figures - banker Viktar Babaryka, YouTube blogger Siarhei Tsikhanouski and ex-diplomat Valery Tsapkala. 

3/x https://t.co/j0364DEAZM ~tweetbreak~ All these three challengers were ultimately eliminated from the race by the repressive state machine. Babaryka and Tsikhanouski got detained on dubious charges, and all three were ultimately not registered. But then an unexpected twist happened, which changed the race.

4/x https://t.co/vYfOfP1cUN ~tweetbreak~ Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of detained blogger, decided to run for presidency in his place. And she was ultimately registered as a candidate, as the sexist incumbent did not expect that a women, let alone a housewife can be a real challenge in this election.

5/x https://t.co/Nku9klWk8n ~tweetbreak~ On 14 July the Central Election Commission (CEC) registered Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya as one of the 5 presidential candidates. Two other alternative candidates - Viktar Babaryka and Valery Tsapkala were disqualified on alleged procedural grounds. 

https://t.co/0wdtlO0liu
6/x https://t.co/KY60cUoZgi ~tweetbreak~ Two days later Sviatlana united forces with campaigns of Babaryka (with his campaign chief Maryia Kalesnikava in the photo on the left) and Tsapkala (with his wife Veranika on the right). This  pulled together resources and people.

https://t.co/a9PG0uuWhJ
7/x ~tweetbreak~ Social media in Belarus quickly responded to Tsikhanouskaya's candidacy - and her strongly feminist campaign, aided by other female politicians - with memes. And these memes clearly paint her as a favoured candidate for those on the internet:

8/x https://t.co/rV1GoPjyxj ~tweetbreak~ From late July Sviatlana and her team toured #Belarus gathering massive crowds of supporters - with up to 70,000 in Minsk and up to 20,000 in regional cities. This is unprecedented level of political mobilisation in Belarus in recent decades:

9/x https://t.co/ughPvKhYJo ~tweetbreak~ Sviatlana's electoral programme is simple:

1) Release all the political prisoners.
2) Hold a referendum on returning to the 1994 constitution, bringing back checks and balances to the political system.
3) Hold a fresh presidential election within 6 months.

10/x https://t.co/K65NYKHdmS ~tweetbreak~ The Belarusian authorities resorted to the usual tactics: they disrupted Sviatlana's campaign events in the past week, detained protesters, and declared turnout of 41.7% in the 5 days of early voting (a method of electoral rigging).

https://t.co/s60gyWdpv8
11/x https://t.co/gssjhgJPsi ~tweetbreak~ Political opinion polls are banned in Belarus, therefore we do not know electoral sentiment. But based on large protest support for Tsikhanouskaya, it looks as incumbent Lukashenka enjoys no more than 20-25% (or less!) support - mostly the loyalists and the siloviki. 

12/x https://t.co/flglu0Lydn ~tweetbreak~ In a free and fair election Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya would probably emerge as a winner. But Belarus being Belarus, I expect that the CEC will declare Lukashenka as winner of the election, with some 70-75% of the vote. Such result will be a complete fabrication. 

13/x https://t.co/ZvYpHD3rBq ~tweetbreak~ So the big question is what happens in the days after the election. Protests are likely, but the police are likely to use force to disperse and detain protesters in large numbers. There are already reports of military vehicles on the streets of Minsk:

14/x https://t.co/tmwyh3lHKq ~tweetbreak~ If there is significant violence by the police and security services against peaceful protesters in Minsk and other cities in Belarus, this will likely lead to calls for Western countries (EU, US, etc) to re-introduce sanctions against Lukashenka and his regime. 

15/x https://t.co/Kkq1fOU0un ~tweetbreak~ If new Western sanctions against Belarusian leadership emerge, Lukashenka's victory will become a Pyrrhic one, as it will weaken him in any negotiations with Russia. Putin is likely to push for more concessions, including further political integration &amp; military bases.

16/x https://t.co/5pE7dwP6uU ~tweetbreak~ So by keeping power in Minsk in this year's sham ""election"", Lukashenka is actually likely to lose out as Belarusian sovereignty will likely be eroded further by the Union State of Russia and Belarus. 

17/x https://t.co/ojwSTzZjge ~tweetbreak~ An alternative scenario, albeit less likely: if Belarusians do not stop the resistance despite the government repression, and continue with non-violent but longer term resistance, through strikes and peaceful protests. This will crack the elites, eroding Lukashenka's power

18/x https://t.co/EqHxuEm5SI ~tweetbreak~ Under this scenario, a ""Velvet Revolution"" similar to that of Armenia in 2018, can emerge, with groups of the elites - and siloviki - withdrawing their support for Lukashenka, and switching side to the popular sentiment. However, I think that this scenario is less likely

19/x https://t.co/3jaz1GhWNj ~tweetbreak~ My hope for the next few days is that there is no excessive police violence on streets of Minsk and other cities, and that no blood will be shed. Belarus deserves a better future than the one offered by the current repressive state built by Lukashenka in the past 26 years.

#","Some big news out of the University of Arizona (@uarizona):

UA scientists &amp; staff found a coronavirus outbreak on campus *before it happened* ‚Äî and seem to have snuffed it out.

How in the world do you do that?

You use wastewater testing. ~tweetbreak~ 2/ UArizona is one of the schools that has determined to have some in-person classes, and to welcome students back to campus dorms.

Students started moving into dorms about 2 weeks ago.

Class started ‚Äî on-line &amp; in-person ‚Äî Monday. ~tweetbreak~ 3/ As campus reopened, Arizona set up a system to test the wastewater leaving about 20 buildings on campus, including all the dorms that are occupied.

Early work in Europe in the spring showed that people infected with coronavirus shed it into their stool very early. ~tweetbreak~ 4/ All dorms had been tested once and come up negative.

On Tuesday, one dorm ‚Äî Likins Hall ‚Äî showed coronavirus in the wastewater.

On Wednesday, all 311 residents of Likins were given antigen quick-tests. 2 residents were found to be positive ‚Äî asymptomatic, but positive. ~tweetbreak~ 5/ Those 2 Arizona undergrads are in isolation at UA's isolation dorm now (&amp; their contacts being traced).

The other 309 residents of Likins: Back to covid-life-on-campus.

Mind you, all 311 of those residents had already been tested once, on arrival, and come up negative. ~tweetbreak~ 6/ And the initial test of the dorm's wastewater last week was negative.

So those 2 students caught the virus somewhere between coming back to school and Tuesday.

But imagine what would have happened without the wastewater testing. ~tweetbreak~ 7/ Those two students would have wandered their dorm, asymptomatic, likely infecting their fellow students unknowingly.

Then instead of 2 students in Likins being infected, you might have had 10.

Those students would have been out and about on campus, and in Tucson. ~tweetbreak~ 8/ Arizona doesn't yet have a follow-up testing regime for its students living on-campus. You had to be negative to move into the dorms, there is talk of testing everyone every 2 weeks ‚Äî but for now, more testing is voluntary.

(You can get a quick test every day if you want.) ~tweetbreak~ 9/ But wastewater testing is a reasonable surrogate. 

In Europe, it caught infections a week before anyone showed symptoms.

In practice, at UArizona, that's exactly what happened: A dorm outbreak, detected, isolated, stopped in its tracks.

This is how you do it. ~tweetbreak~ 10/ Remember the fruitless mantra of the spring?

Testing.
Testing.
Testing.

It's still true. Testing is how you find infections, testing is how you protect people who might get sick, testing is how you protect everyone who isn't yet infected. ~tweetbreak~ 11/ Wastewater testing is not common at all ‚Äî here in the US, or anywhere else.

It requires a consistent population (you wouldn't want to wastewater test a restaurant or a movie theater), it requires access to the pipes, &amp; an understanding of the plumbing. ~tweetbreak~ 12/ Most important: Wastewater testing requires the ability to do follow-up testing completely &amp; quickly. 

They didn't test a few kids living in Likins. They tested them all.

They didn't test them using a method that required a 3-day wait for results. 1-hour antigen test. ~tweetbreak~ 13/ Lots of *cities* don't have much in the way of quick-test ability on demand.

But this is how it's done. This is how you find people who might get sick, isolate them, and get back to work.

Imagine using wastewater testing at high schools, for instance, or workplaces. ~tweetbreak~ 14/ Arizona has the scientists on campus to develop and manage its wastewater testing. But this is not arcane science.

And to be clear: UA has 5,000 people living on-campus, but another 25,000 living off-campus.

It could still have an outbreak, and have to go all-online. ~tweetbreak~ 15/ UArizona's most recent testing data:

Total tests since reopening:
‚Ä¢ 10,126 tests
 --&gt;46 positive

Wednesday, 8/26 testing:
‚Ä¢ 770 tests
 --&gt; 9 positive

Note that yesterday's results are a small warning.

Overall positive rate: 0.5%
Yesterday's positive rate: 1.2% ~tweetbreak~ 16/ That dramatic jump in positivity might be a quirk of testing and who walked in yesterday. Might be a sign that as students and staff come back to campus, use the restaurants and the classrooms and see each other on the lawns, some transmission might be happening. ~tweetbreak~ 17/ But UArizona's wastewater testing is a smart, invaluable technique.

Let's hope other colleges and universities, and lots of other organizations, jump in and put it to use as well.

#OldWeirdScotland https://t.co/mqolU9LTry","Summer 1970: a rare form of typhoid is infecting people in Edinburgh. Dr Nancy Conn, a bacteriologist at Western General, finds the source and prevents a major outbreak with detective work and sanitary towels. 

A thread on one of Scotland's unsung #WomenInSTEM

#OldWeirdScotland https://t.co/Od5KQuOB9p ~tweetbreak~ Typhoid was and is uncommon in Scotland. Apart from an outbreak in Aberdeen in the 60s, most cases are linked to overseas travel. The Edinburgh outbreak was different. It was mainly children who were being infected, from different parts of the city. 1/n ~tweetbreak~ None of them had ever been abroad and none had any link to India, where this rare strain of the Salmonella typhi bacterium comes from. Dr Conn sat with the patients and interviewed them in detail. Many were senseless with fever. She interviewed their friends and families too. 2/n ~tweetbreak~ Only one thing seemed to link them-- they had all played, fished, or picnicked at the Water of Leith--some had drunk the water. Dr Conn mapped out where the patients had been, but it covered a sizable stretch of a fairly polluted river.  3/n https://t.co/H3PNEJPwvQ ~tweetbreak~ Dr Conn set out to test the river water across the whole area the children had played. The standard protocol for collecting bacteria, known as Moore swabs, kept failing, got muddy and disintegrated in the fast, dirty river. Dr Conn made her own sturdy replacement samplers. 4/n https://t.co/u2u3wv62zw ~tweetbreak~ The sanitary towels, after being sunk in the river, were taken back to the lab and cultured. Some had collected the bacterium. Just upstream from the first one that came back positive, Dr Conn found a surface water drain outlet. Problem is, typhoid shouldn't be in rain water. 5/n https://t.co/quiBZAFzno ~tweetbreak~ The outlet drained rain and surface water from all of the north of Colinton. Dr Conn called the City Engineers. She gave them packs of Dr White's No. 1 sanitary towels and showed them how to use them. They put them down every drain and manhole north of the river to sample. 6/n ~tweetbreak~ Like before in the river, Dr Conn cultured the samples in the lab and narrowed in on the source: one surface water drain that ran by one particular block of houses. The engineers dug up the road to investigate. 

The number of typhoid cases was rising. 7/n https://t.co/qzSXCVuvCp ~tweetbreak~ Sewer pipes are always installed below surface water drains for safety (in case the sewer leaks). When the housing block was built in the 1890s, the position of the pipes was switched, and so got connected up to the wrong outlets by the city.  8/n https://t.co/gJV17Vkv3S ~tweetbreak~ Dr Conn took samples from the sludge traps of the 12 houses in the block and narrowed the source of the typhoid down to 2 houses (P and Q). To spare the residents embarrassment, she asked all houses to take part in a ""survey"" and collected samples from everyone. 9/n https://t.co/eRQ9RCUPBh ~tweetbreak~ The source was a 76 year old woman who lived alone.  She had never once been ill. She had never been abroad. She had lived in that house for 13 years. If not for Dr Conn and the faulty drains, she'd never have known she was an #asymptomaticcarrier of a rare Asiatic typhoid. 10/n ~tweetbreak~ The carrier was identified 2 weeks before the last admitted typhoid case thanks to Dr Conn working *flat out* for 2 months. The carrier got treatment and the sewers were fixed, though they both remained positive for several months. So how did she become a healthy carrier? 11/n ~tweetbreak~ Dr Conn interviewed her but, in short, nobody knows. She lived alone for most of her life, except with her father, who was a horse vet in the second Boer War and did travel afterwards. Maybe he was also an #asymptomatic carrier of Salmonella typhi K1 and she got it from him? 12/n https://t.co/vRlY5ilr1E ~tweetbreak~ Nancy Conn's quick and methodical investigation stopped the outbreak of typhoid in Edinburgh. Folk stopped drinking from the Water of Leith and eventually the river got cleaned up. This photo is from the 1983 ""Operation Riverbank"" in Leith. 13/n https://t.co/xMqJfMChMH ~tweetbreak~ Dr Agnes ""Nancy"" Kirkland Conn retired in 1979 and died in March 2013 aged 93.

https://t.co/KZcqy13OMK

1/ https://t.co/k2BnHjuu6a ~tweetbreak~ But when he submitted his first assignment, he was aghast to receive a 50% grade on it. 

The assignment was graded by @EdgenuityInc, a machine learning grift that purports to generate grades for overworked, beleagured teachers.

2/ ~tweetbreak~ Simmons calls it an ""automatic grading algorithm that values only rote repetition,"" and to prove the point, she told her son how to please the machine: long sentences with a lot of proper names.

3/ ~tweetbreak~ It worked: now her son submits ""word salads"" consisting of two sentences (long ones, presumably) and a bunch of keywords from the lesson, and is consistently earning 100% grades. As Simmons says, ""He went from an F to an A+ without learning a thing.""

4/ ~tweetbreak~ In @mathbabedotorg's seminal ""Weapons of Math Destruction,"" she doesn't just provide a devastating critique of the underlying statistical basis for machine learning, but also a set of VERY useful rules of thumb for spotting AI grifters.

https://t.co/YGw1rnY7OR

5/ ~tweetbreak~ First: if a company provides an AI but doesn't check its predictions, they don't give a shit about its accuracy. 

Think about it: if Amazon uses ML to predict whether moving the BUY button will generate more sales, the DEFINITELY measure whether sales after moving it.

6/ ~tweetbreak~ The fact that this automated grading system produces estimates that are so easily gamed tells you it is a straight-up grift. I mean, the Bayesian spam filters of the mid-2000s were able to detect the ""word salad"" attack. 

7/ ~tweetbreak~ This isn't one of those subtle, amazing ""adversarial example"" attacks on a ML model - like that weird thing where a vision system is tricked into thinking that a rifle is a helicopter:

https://t.co/efhpoA4Mo8

8/ ~tweetbreak~ It's more like a password prompt that you can bypass just by hitting the spacebar a bunch of times. 

That is: negligent garbage serving no pedagogical purpose, an embodiment of the enterprise software pathology where the person who buys the product doesn't have to use it.

9/ ~tweetbreak~ Simmons is admirably compassionate about the whole affair: ""teaching online is overwhelming and you can't do it all. _Please_, use the algorithm to track their learning. But don't post to them as if it's a measure of their performance. It's more destructive than you know.""

10/ ~tweetbreak~ Amen. 

School boards shouldn't be buying this tool for teachers.

Teachers shouldn't be using it to assess students.

Students should not be made to see those assessments.

Strap in, this is important. 1/x

https://t.co/rR4aBDK4Xl ~tweetbreak~ It turns out that the PCR, that old reliable workhorse, is both too slow and too sensitive for what we need. And it all hinges on a metric called the ‚Äúcycle threshold.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a handy explanation of what the CT value is and why it matters. 2/x

https://t.co/ejOY7JQ9Kp ~tweetbreak~ Essentially, the PCR test amplifies genetic matter from the virus in cycles; the fewer cycles required, the greater the amount of virus, or viral load, in the sample. The greater the viral load, the more likely the patient is to be contagious.  3/x ~tweetbreak~ Here‚Äôs where it gets truly shocking. Most PCR machines at state labs are set to a cutoff of 40 or 37, meaning it takes that many cycles to get a signal. But acc to most virologists, at that level, you are amplifying so little virus that it might almost be an artifact. 4/x ~tweetbreak~ If you adjust that down to a more reasonable CT threshold of 30, anywhere form 40%-90% of state lab results are *no longer positive.* The rest are well past the point of contagiousness. 5/x ~tweetbreak~ Think about that for a minute. Think of the thousands of people being asked to isolate, refrain from work and submit to contact tracing. But also, think of the needless bottlenecks, and all the people who aren‚Äôt getting tested and isolated *when* they need to be. 6/x ~tweetbreak~ Imagine a neighborhood on fire. Here, the firefighters have defined even dying embers as a ‚Äúfire‚Äù and are so busy putting those out that they are missing entire homes that are burning down and setting others ablaze. 7/x ~tweetbreak~ Let‚Äôs be very clear: this is not an argument for testing less. It‚Äôs an argument for testing MORE and testing more OFTEN. With rapid, less sensitive tests that tell you what you actually need to know from a public health perspective: whether you are contagious. 8/x ~tweetbreak~ Apart from the mind-blowing public health implications of these numbers, we are also losing valuable scientific intel about the virus and disease trajectory by not paying attention to CT values and delivering just yes-no answers (per FDA authorizations). 9/x ~tweetbreak~ Massive thanks to @michaelmina_lab who alerted me to this, and to @JumoDr @angie_rasmussen @ashishkjha @scottjbecker and many others, incl at state labs.  --/10

#BlackLivesMatter ~tweetbreak~ Scientific racism is basically as old as what we now call science.

From the Enlightenment on, there was a big push to understand what race was. Somehow, almost all those early scientists agreed that a ""white race"" was ""superior"".

Here's some of them, see if you notice anything. https://t.co/5DN6Dqs2uK ~tweetbreak~ As the role of the brain in human behavior became clear, scientific racism spilled into the newborn area of neuroscience.

That likely started with craniometry, measurements of the skull, which quickly turned to phrenology, the idea that head shapes can predict mental traits. https://t.co/a3zkRCVlAJ ~tweetbreak~ Their main idea was that you could gauge the racial intellectual ability by measuring the volume of their skull.
 
Most famously, Samuel Morton claimed that Caucasians had the largest skull capacities (shockingly). His research was highly biased, but unfortunately influential. https://t.co/bQLY1G8LG3 ~tweetbreak~ Alongside, phrenology was gaining popularity. Like most pseudoscience, phrenology was built around 
oversimplifications and misinterpretations of science.
 
While it did help move some aspects of neuroscience forward, it was also used extensively to justify slavery and misogyny. https://t.co/1V9AqAOi9l ~tweetbreak~ Those early examples of scientific racism paved the way for much of the eugenics movement in the 20th century.

Eugenics itself was broader than neuroscience, but intelligence tests and an obsession with mentally ""strong"" played a huge part in racist policies enacted before WW2. https://t.co/awUhEMrqgf ~tweetbreak~ Intelligence tests and their biases deserve a whole other discussion, but keep in mind the notion that one number could describe something as complex as human intelligence was already contested at the time (~ 1910s).
 
But that didn't stop racism. ~tweetbreak~ Lead by Henry Goddard and Lewis Terman, two prominent eugenicists, the US adapted and adopted the first versions of IQ tests, firstly created in France.
 
Based on those tests, and combating what they called ""feeble-mindedness"", eugenicists pushed laws for forced sterilization. https://t.co/ENTcJqhuCz ~tweetbreak~ It is estimated that over 60,000 people, most of them minority women, in the US alone went through state-sponsored forced sterilization.
 
The SCOTUS ruling that allowed this (Buck v. Bell) has never been expressly overturned. ~tweetbreak~ Even after WW2, there's still a whole lot of racism that goes into certain neuroscience topics, especially when discussing intelligence.

Pseudoscientific books like A Troublesome Inheritance (2014) and The Bell Curve (1994) still reflect racist and eugenic views to this day. ~tweetbreak~ As we get better at examining the brain in detail, there will likely be more misinterpretations and misuses of research for racist reasons.

That's why it is so vital to fight for inclusion, in an actual meaningful way. 

Science is not apolitical, and it'll never be. ~tweetbreak~ References: https://t.co/Lc9DOUYjuC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

(23)","What if Earth had no moon? ‚úñÔ∏èüåï 
(1) https://t.co/pCoe7Wi7Ti ~tweetbreak~ Many of us enjoy looking up at the Moon at night, but we don't really stop to think about the true importance of our bright friend in the sky. We know that most of the other planets in our Solar System have more than one moon, so they would be fine if a few went missing. 
(2) ~tweetbreak~ Most of their moons are also much smaller than ours, which means they probably don't have as much of a significant impact on the planet as our moon does. 
Now, we all know about the Moon and its direct relationship to the tides, as well as illuminating our night sky, but... 
(3) https://t.co/MikL06ETAG ~tweetbreak~ what if we had no moon? How would our lives change? 
How would Earth as a whole change? 
Let's start with probably the biggest and most noticeable change of them all: nights. 
Without a moon, our nights would be UNBELIEVABLY dark, since it provides us light once the Sun sets.
(4) https://t.co/ZTfbKt5bQZ ~tweetbreak~ Even though we may be asleep for most of the night, there are nocturnal predators which use the Moon for hunting purposes. Their ways of hunting prey would probably completely change (or they would probably evolve to have better vision). 
(5) https://t.co/3BylbjxKht ~tweetbreak~ https://t.co/NpKklzEtFG puts into perspective just how dark it would be at night without a moon: ""Scientists suggest that without human-made lighting, we would not be able to see our hands in front of our face without the Moon during nighttime.""
That's absolutely terrifying.
(6) ~tweetbreak~ I mean, second to the Moon, the next brightest object in the night sky is Venus, which obviously would not be bright enough to illuminate the night sky due to its distance from us. 
(7) https://t.co/tAuz0twjh8 ~tweetbreak~ That's only the nights though. Our days would be affected as well with no moon. A simple lesson in gravity will tell you that both the Earth and Moon exert a gravitational pull on one another. In fact, the Moon is actually the object that slows down Earth's rotation due... 
(8) https://t.co/dIPhSUr0Wl ~tweetbreak~ to the pull it's exerting on our planet. 
Most of us are familiar with the fact that the Moon is responsible for the tides. Its pull causes the oceans to rise and fall. Due to the moving water, there is very slight friction from the oceans on the surface of the Earth. 
(9) ~tweetbreak~ Since we're talking about what it would be like to not have a moon, however, it's assumed that the water on the surface of the Earth would spread uniformly across the planet and the rotation would speed up. This leads me into the topic of time. We have months because of... 
(10) ~tweetbreak~ the phases of the Moon, which gives us around 30-31 days each month (except February of course, which is the oddball month and my birth month coincidentally, but that doesn't matter). 
If the Earth is rotating faster, then it's safe to assume that our days themselves... 
(11) https://t.co/7wKXIkTDMw ~tweetbreak~ would be shorter. There's a saying that we ""only have 24 hours in a day,"" but without the Moon, we would probably be experiencing days that are between 6-12 hours, so good luck getting much work done then. Also, getting a decent amount of sleep would be difficult as... 
(12) ~tweetbreak~ well, since adults need around 8 hours. This means that we would have to completely change our calendar to account for this change, so instead of the usual 365 days that we have in a year, we would most likely have over 1,000 (I don't even want to imagine that). 
(13) https://t.co/wJvYnNyRnZ ~tweetbreak~ Now let's talk briefly about the biggest thing that the Moon affects on Earth: the tides. The Moon affects the tides by exerting a gravitational pull on them. This causes the water to bulge toward where the Moon is-AKA high tide. On the side of the Earth where the water... 
(14) ~tweetbreak~ does not bulge toward the Moon, it moves away-AKA low tide. These tides are also affected by the motion of the Earth while it's rotating. 
Here's a helpful graphic that I've used in a previous thread about if Earth had more than one moon: 
(15) https://t.co/qVMPnER0Ei ~tweetbreak~ Without the Moon and the gravitational pull that it provides, the tides would shrink. ""Scientists suggest that without the Moon, tides would be 1/3 of the size they are now"" (https://t.co/38aqqDYcSe). The Sun also influences tides, but its pull is much weaker, since it's... 
(16) ~tweetbreak~ further away from the earth than the Moon. This means that coastal areas would be affected and the economy of fishing and transporting things by boat would also be heavily impacted. 
(17) ~tweetbreak~ The Moon's pull is known to slow down the Earth's rotation, but if there wasn't a moon, then the Earth's rotation would be faster, which would influence our weather patterns and wind speeds (the wind speeds would increase without the Moon). 
(18) https://t.co/nNvv8rlGS7 ~tweetbreak~ If the change in weather doesn't interest you, then the dramatic change in seasons might. The Moon impacts the angle of Earth's tilt. Again, this is due to its gravitational pull. This is actually a good thing, because the Moon essentially keeps the Earth form wobbling. 
(19) https://t.co/PeJ2cHftEd ~tweetbreak~ It stabilizes where the Earth is tilted. Earth is at a 23.5 degree tilt, which does mean that it leans slightly more on one side than the other. This tilt is responsible for our seasons. If we didn't have a moon, the tilt would change, which would drastically affect the... 
(20) ~tweetbreak~ seasons and weather. There are two scenarios: we would either have a very extreme tilt with more extreme weather, or we would have virtually no tilt at all and basically no seasons. 
(21) https://t.co/1VSEoy9IF8 ~tweetbreak~ Final thoughts: As you could probably tell after reading all of this, the Moon is SUPER important for us, not only because of all of the vital components that it controls on Earth, but because it's the only other body that humans have been able to stand on apart from Earth! 
(22) https://t.co/0yHQhIlwbF ~tweetbreak~ I know that certain billionaires are trying to send people to Mars right now, but we don't know how far in the future that will be. 
We may not even have gone into space at all if there wasn't a moon, and that's scary and sad to think about.

I defer to the math education experts but as a Harvard student in a mathematical field I do know a little about learning math. üßµ ~tweetbreak~ My experience with learning math is before you can progress to the next level, you need to develop mental models of the current material that allow you to think extremely quickly. The best teachers will give you the models, but you might have to find or invent them yourself. ~tweetbreak~ Good representations are only half the story because you also need to practice them over and over again until they're automatic. I'm not a psychologist. So I don't know but maybe there are people who are naturally quick or can come up with their own models easily. ~tweetbreak~ I don't think it matters how you get the right mental models as long as you use them. Once you have the these models, I've found that learning math calculations isn't any more complicated than learning dance moves. ~tweetbreak~ The important thing is it's not enough to UNDERSTAND. You have to be FAST and you can get there through a combination of good mental models AND practice. ~tweetbreak~ Math piles abstractions on top of abstractions. You have to know the early stuff to get the later stuff. So if you're not fast at the lower level material, the lack of speed piles up until you can barely move forward. Most people then feel like they've hit a ""ceiling"" with math. ~tweetbreak~ I saw this when I was tutoring. Kids that needed a calculator to add ""8+7"" were usually in deep trouble because that meant ""8x+7x"" required them to pause and think, and then ""8x+7(x+9y)"" was an absolute chore, which means calculus was mission impossible for them! ~tweetbreak~ My advice to anybody who feels like they hit a ceiling with math is to go backwards down the stack and work on your speed at the lower levels. You will find that this will free up a lot of mental energy to move forward with the higher level stuff. ~tweetbreak~ The way the school system is structured, people often get pushed into new math classes when they aren't fully prepared. Even getting an A in the previous material doesn't mean you have built up the speed needed for the next level. ~tweetbreak~ Often when people feel overwhelmed by the pace, math phobia can set in. Fear is the mind killer. It makes it harder to concentrate which makes the lack of speed even worse! This is why working on your speed is critical! ~tweetbreak~ To summarize. My advice for people who hit a math ""ceiling"" is:

1. Go backwards to earlier stuff if you need to

2. Slow down until you get it

3. Focus on your speed once you understand!

Lots of other people can talk about why it was technologically interesting, but I want to share a bit about why it was so *culturally* interesting. ~tweetbreak~ For context, in 1995, only about 30% of American homes had a computer at all. Less than 10% had *any* internet access ‚Äî and virtually none had broadband. There were no smartphones. ~tweetbreak~ More broadly, computers and software were basically not yet something talked about in polite company. You might have had a friend who ‚Äúworked in computers‚Äù (we didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwork in tech‚Äù yet) or call IT for support for your printer at work. But ‚Äúapps‚Äù were not part of culture. ~tweetbreak~ At that point, most job listings didn‚Äôt even yet ask for ‚Äúfamiliarity with MS Office‚Äù (ask your parents what that meant) and the PlayStation hadn‚Äôt been released yet. ~tweetbreak~ Consumer marketing of PC technology was in its infancy; Intel had just named (earlier processors only really had model numbers) the Pentium not long before, and its name became famous when a bug was found in the early chips. Jokes about that were as far as pop culture tech went. ~tweetbreak~ Into that world, Microsoft did a mass consumer launch of‚Ä¶ an operating system. The most abstract product possible. They got Jay Leno to host a launch event, and licensed the Rolling Stones‚Äô ‚ÄúStart Me Up‚Äù as a theme song. ~tweetbreak~ Wildly, it worked. For the first time ever, lots of consumer enthusiasts lined up to buy software at stores as it released at midnight; that kind of enthusiasm had been limited to album releases and movie opening before that point. ~tweetbreak~ And the enthusiasm had been building for almost 2 years by launch. Trade magazines wrote about ‚ÄúChicago‚Äù, the codename for the product, and geeks tried out the early public betas of the operating system ‚Äî helping popularize the idea of a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù in culture overall. ~tweetbreak~ Modern tech culture and tech trade press still basically follow the conventions that developed back then. Reporters breathlessly cover new codenames and rumors and beta releases, and late night TV hosts don‚Äôt just joke about apps, they deliver their shows *through* them. ~tweetbreak~ The operating system itself was fine; the user interface and design were certainly a leap forward. But the most lasting impact is how it changed the broader cultural perception of technology. ~tweetbreak~ In the 80s, there had been a movie series ‚ÄúRevenge of the Nerds‚Äù; its last sequel came out only a year before Windows 95 did. Tech was seen as for those people ‚Äî nerds who were walking punchlines. But after that point, tech quickly became a standard part of people‚Äôs lives. ~tweetbreak~ Not long after, the Internet became mainstream, software became something everyone uses (as ‚Äúapps‚Äù), and operating systems became a capability bundled with the entire tech ecosystems where we live our lives, both ubiquitous and invisible. And the Start button is still cool! ~tweetbreak~ Brad was the SVP in charge of the Chicago/Win95 release. PC Magazine (then arguably the most credible mass-market tech publication) named him Person of the Year for it. https://t.co/0uHaPKUhUb ~tweetbreak~ I turned this thread into a full blog post with more details and context, please do take a look! https://t.co/0pyyoUDluG",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

There are at least FOUR different scenarios!

A thread. üßµ ~tweetbreak~ 1. CORRELATED BY CHANCE. There's always a possibility that variables will correlate by chance. If you have a lot of data, you're almost certain to get a few high correlations. You will know you're in this situation if the same variables are much less correlated in new data. ~tweetbreak~ 2. CORRELATED DUE TO STRUCTURE. Clocks are correlated with each other but there's nothing about Clock A that can be changed in order to cause a change in Clock B or vice versa. There is no third thing you can change that will cause both clocks to change. There is no causation. ~tweetbreak~ You might be tempted to say that the clocks have the common cause of being created by humans. Imagine two random stars that have a cyclical change in brightness every 24 hours. They will be correlated as well. It's not about who created them. It's about their similar structure. ~tweetbreak~ 3. MURKY CAUSATION. In the simplest case, if A and B are correlated and there is some causation then this could mean that A causes B, B causes A or some third thing C causes both A and B. In the most complex case, there could be complicated feedback loops between A and B. ~tweetbreak~ In these cases, when we say ""correlation isn't causation"", what we mean is that we can't identify exactly what kind of causation there is but there is some. ~tweetbreak~ 4. EVEN MURKIER CAUSATION. A and B might not be related at all in the real world but something about your data collection may have caused data about A to be related to data about B. Technically, you could say you or your data collection are the cause of the correlation. ~tweetbreak~ However, in the context of the original variables themselves and the real world, A is not causally related to B.

#Infection #Spread #Uncertainty #Misinformation","1/ Q: When will we get to herd immunity?

A: When we get a vaccine &amp; lots of people have received it; or else, a very long time from now. https://t.co/PL9Ba0Jgfy ~tweetbreak~ 2/ Even though we have well over 30 million confirmed cases &amp; nearly a million deaths from #COVID19 worldwide, we‚Äôre not even close to reaching herd immunity. In fact, we're not even close to the lowest estimates for herd immunity in the places that were absolutely slammed early. ~tweetbreak~ 3/ Most scientists think that we need around 60-70% of people to be immune to #COVID19 in order to reach herd immunity. Herd immunity happens when a virus is starved of new hosts because susceptible people are so rare in the population. ~tweetbreak~ 4/ We can get that herd immunity threshold a little bit lower if we‚Äôre really strategic about who is immune. For example, for pertussis (known as whooping cough), you may have noticed that recent public health campaigns focus on vaccinating grandparents. ~tweetbreak~ 5/ Vaccinating grandparents is important because immunity from the pertussis vaccine starts to wear off as we age. We‚Äôre protecting newborns by making sure the people around them are immune. This strategy is called cocooning. ~tweetbreak~ 6/ There are other strategic ways to get the effective herd immunity threshold to be a little lower, such as requiring nursing home employees to be vaccinated annually for influenza. But even with a strategic program, we probably can‚Äôt get the threshold a lot lower than 60%. ~tweetbreak~ 7/ We‚Äôve been through the looking glass for 9 months, &amp; so far about 6.9 million people in the U.S. have confirmed infections. That‚Äôs about equal to the total population of the state of Arizona. ~tweetbreak~ 8/ Now let's do some imagining. Let's assume that having been previously infected actually does make us immune for life (which is still an open question). Let's also assume that we've under-identified cases--in fact we've only identified 1 in every 5 cases. ~tweetbreak~ 9/ That means we only have another 136 million cases to go until we reach herd immunity! 136 million people is roughly the combined population of the 10 biggest cities in the U.S. PLUS the entire population of FL., OH., GA, NC., MI., NJ., VA., WA., AZ., &amp; TN. Combined. ~tweetbreak~ 10/ We would also expect between 500,000 &amp; 2 million deaths, depending on how good we are at protecting our most vulnerable from infection. For comparison, the number of deaths would be something like the total population of New Hampshire. ~tweetbreak~ 11/ Now, let‚Äôs say that we‚Äôre all willing to accept the *completely insane* number of deaths involved in getting to herd immunity through natural infection. (Which, for the record, we are not. That is *not* a good public health strategy.) ~tweetbreak~ 12/ At the current rate, we‚Äôll reach herd immunity in‚Ä¶ 14 years &amp; 5 months!

When &amp; if an effective vaccine becomes available, we‚Äôll still need to vaccinate millions &amp; millions of people. But when we get vaccinated, we become immune *without getting sick*. ~tweetbreak~ 13/ Because of this cruel math &amp; other reasons, the only reasonable way to achieve herd immunity is through a vaccine that is effective &amp; widely adopted.

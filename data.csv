Today is the day of presidential election in my native Belarus. It is the 6th election in Belarusian history. Only 1994 election was deemed free and fair, and votes in 2001, 2006, 2010 and 2015 were marred by electoral fraud and government repression.

Belarus deserves a better future than the one offered by the current repressive state built by Lukashenka in the past 26 years.

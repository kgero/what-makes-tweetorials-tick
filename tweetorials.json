What do people think happened with African empires &amp; their European counterparts prior to colonization? Perhaps a history lesson is in order. Thread. 1/17","There were so many different African empires, so I\u2019m gonna stick to the empire from which I\u2019m descended--the Benin Empire (what is now Benin City in Edo State in southern Nigeria)--and its relationship with the Portuguese since the early 15th century. 2/17","The Benin empire interacted with the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese throughout its existence, but the Benin-Portugal relationship was the chummiest. They traded goods, languages, histories, lessons. They sent emissaries and scholars to each other &amp; threw big shindigs. 3/17","The Lagos y\u2019all know? Portuguese word for \u201clake,\u201d named back when the land that is now Lagos was still a part of the Benin Empire. Benin Obas spoke Portuguese and sent their subjects to learn about Christianity. Early Benin art had crosses mixed with its own pantheon. 4/17","The Portuguese wanted slaves so Benin sold its POWs. They wanted spices, ivory &amp; coral beads, and offered textiles, tools &amp; weapons in return. They established a factory at Ughoton, Benin\u2019s then seaport city (long before Lagos became one of West Africa\u2019s key slaveports). 5/17","David van Nyendael, on visiting Benin in 1699: \u201cWhen it comes to trade, they are very strict and will not suffer the slightest infringement of their customs...when one is willing to accept these customs, they are very easy-going and will cooperate in every way possible.\u201d 6/17","No surprise, then, that the first point of contention arrived when King Manuel of Portugal wanted commercial monopoly, as well as for the Binis to fully accept Christianity, to which Oba Esigie was like, \u201cExcuse you?\u201d The decline in trade relations began after that. 7/17","Then, there was also disease. Them weak-ass sailors would get bitten by one tiny-ass anopheles mosquito and be like, \u201c*cough cough* Ugh, tell my wife I love her.\u201d The French especially suffered from this.\n\nThen the British arrived, and it all went to shit from there. 8/17","Buoyed by that nonsense Berlin Conference of 1885 (smh), the British started asking for trade monopoly and control. They were so aggressive about it that the Oba banned all other trade with them, save for palm oil (to aid lubrication in the burgeoning European machine age). 9/17","Proud-ass Britain didn\u2019t like being told what to do. They wrote stink pieces, commenced disinformation campaigns. Here\u2019s Consul Richard Burton, in 1862: \u201c...a place of gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death.\" (Like we haven\u2019t seen Oliver Twist. Pot/kettle much?) 10/17","By 1897, the consuls had convinced the Queen with enough lies to gather an army to take Benin by force. \u201cLiberate the people\u201d and convert them to Christianity. (Sound familiar, y\u2019all summer missionary cruisers to the Caribbean with a side-dish of \u201cconverting the natives?\u201d) 11/17","The 1897 Benin Expedition &amp; deposition of Oba Ovonramwen happened then.

What do people think happened with African empires &amp; their European counterparts prior to colonization? Perhaps a history lesson is in order. Thread. 1/17 ~tweetbreak~ There were so many different African empires, so I\u2019m gonna stick to the empire from which I\u2019m descended--the Benin Empire (what is now Benin City in Edo State in southern Nigeria)--and its relationship with the Portuguese since the early 15th century. 2/17 ~tweetbreak~ The Benin empire interacted with the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese throughout its existence, but the Benin-Portugal relationship was the chummiest. They traded goods, languages, histories, lessons. They sent emissaries and scholars to each other &amp; threw big shindigs. 3/17 ~tweetbreak~ The Lagos y\u2019all know? Portuguese word for \u201clake,\u201d named back when the land that is now Lagos was still a part of the Benin Empire. Benin Obas spoke Portuguese and sent their subjects to learn about Christianity. Early Benin art had crosses mixed with its own pantheon. 4/17 ~tweetbreak~ The Portuguese wanted slaves so Benin sold its POWs. They wanted spices, ivory &amp; coral beads, and offered textiles, tools &amp; weapons in return. They established a factory at Ughoton, Benin\u2019s then seaport city (long before Lagos became one of West Africa\u2019s key slaveports). 5/17 ~tweetbreak~ David van Nyendael, on visiting Benin in 1699: \u201cWhen it comes to trade, they are very strict and will not suffer the slightest infringement of their customs...when one is willing to accept these customs, they are very easy-going and will cooperate in every way possible.\u201d 6/17 ~tweetbreak~ No surprise, then, that the first point of contention arrived when King Manuel of Portugal wanted commercial monopoly, as well as for the Binis to fully accept Christianity, to which Oba Esigie was like, \u201cExcuse you?\u201d The decline in trade relations began after that. 7/17 ~tweetbreak~ Then, there was also disease. Them weak-ass sailors would get bitten by one tiny-ass anopheles mosquito and be like, \u201c*cough cough* Ugh, tell my wife I love her.\u201d The French especially suffered from this.\n\nThen the British arrived, and it all went to shit from there. 8/17 ~tweetbreak~ Buoyed by that nonsense Berlin Conference of 1885 (smh), the British started asking for trade monopoly and control. They were so aggressive about it that the Oba banned all other trade with them, save for palm oil (to aid lubrication in the burgeoning European machine age). 9/17 ~tweetbreak~ Proud-ass Britain didn\u2019t like being told what to do. They wrote stink pieces, commenced disinformation campaigns. Here\u2019s Consul Richard Burton, in 1862: \u201c...a place of gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death.\" (Like we haven\u2019t seen Oliver Twist. Pot/kettle much?) 10/17 ~tweetbreak~ By 1897, the consuls had convinced the Queen with enough lies to gather an army to take Benin by force. \u201cLiberate the people\u201d and convert them to Christianity. (Sound familiar, y\u2019all summer missionary cruisers to the Caribbean with a side-dish of \u201cconverting the natives?\u201d) 11/17 ~tweetbreak~ The 1897 Benin Expedition &amp; deposition of Oba Ovonramwen happened then.

Again, this isn't the movies.","3. Research for political campaigns, political action committees, independent expenditure committees is about publicly available information. Now you may wonder, if its publicly available why campaigns have to pay people good money for publicly available info.","4. Putting together publicly available information is not only arduous and exhausting, you would be surprised by how much people miss because they don't know how and where to look for information. Now, what qualifies as publicly available information?","5. Court records, voter registration records, if the candidate is a legislator, their voting record, transcripts of committee hearings, ethics records, every single news clip about them, every video they've ever appeared in from small Democratic Party BBQs to..(cont)","6. Speeches at women's groups to videos from supporters (or haters) on the sidelines of parades. Real estate and tax records. If they own a business or ran a business: employment records, regulatory records (OSHA stuff), licensing records). This is a very short list of examples","7. So here's what research isn't...it's not about gossip, it's not about stuff that sources tell you, and as a researcher, you're not flying to some remote town to talk to people unless it's to talk to the city clerk about divorce records that aren't digitized.","8. So how does research get commissioned? Here's an example. A candidate is running for Senator, they're already an officeholder (let's say state senator). First, they'll commission a self-research packet (which often means several large binders/pdfs). In that packet...","9. They'll find every public statement (of note) they've ever made, donors or fundraisers that may cause issues for them (if they're smart they would vett donors before they take $$), everything re their voting record, videos - all the stuff I talked about earlier in the thread.","10. Then when they launch their campaign, a smart manager/general consultant won't have full research books done on every candidate. A book will only be done on one or two candidates at most normally but the manager will request top line hits on some other candidates","11. Top line hits mean that the researcher can put stuff together in a couple days usually and involve any tax liens, lawsuits, controversial videos/statements, bad business stuff etc.","12. Now, what researchers do that's so critical is they know, they have a sense of what matters in campaigns. They don't just plop all the information in a binder, they organize it in a way that prioritizes the information. They also, often, construct a narrative","13. So at the start of a book (if the researcher is good) you'll find basic information on the candidate, everything from DOB to addresses, marriages, children, social media accounts. Then you'll find a timeline of their life. From birth to present day. Timeline is critical","14. Because it allows the campaign team to understand where they may find more information OR (and this is where I talk about reporters)..its where they can guide reporters. So, for example, a press person can tell a reporter \"hey, Joe Smith lived in North Dakota for a year..\"","15. That may peak the reporters interest, that information may not have been easily available. The reporter may wonder why someone who spent their entire life in Southern California randomly lived in North Dakota for a year. Maybe there's something there?","16. Research books those two big sections are organized in sections after that (ex. voting record, real estate records etc). There are normally a few subsections on each page, a title for that subsection and then normally a paragraph of info under that section. Example...","17. \"Joe Smith Accepted $300,000 in donations from Oil Companies\" - then the paragraph may include something like this \"including $25,000 from Alan Jones who was fined by the EPA 120 separate times.\" All of this is publicly available.","18. Another section may start with something like this \"Joe Smith, When He Was A City Council Member, Repeatedly Prevented The Council From Settling With A Sexual Harassment Victim.\" Again, old records but public records. These are all great \"hits\" on a candidate","19. There's so much more and the thing that researchers get really good at is learning what will really make an impact. Think the oil company donations will make a difference? Probably not. What will make a difference? That Joe Smith had 20 unpaid parking tickets.","20. May sound silly to some but that's the kind of thing that pisses of voters and makes them wonder about that candidates ability to handle simple stuff. So here's a little something about researchers..","21. Researchers are not shadowy figures who look like PIs in movies. They're nerdy, they look more like someone you'd find at the Genius Bar at Apple than an FBI. Field Office. Researchers are obsessive and odd. Soo many of the researchers I know are obsessed with unusual things","22. Several researchers I know are obsessed with learning languages like Greek and Latin. They get true joy from finding stuff no one else did. They're not driven by destroying someone but by uncovering the truth..no matter who it is about or where it is.","23. Ok so you have your research book...do you just hand it over to reporters? NO! I have never known anyone to ever do this..ever! Oppo dump is a ridiculous term. Most of the time, 99% of the research stays with the campaign. The candidate uses it to beef up on their opponent","24. The research is used for social media posts, debates (a big one), tv, digital, and radio ads, and for stump speeches. What is passed onto reporters? Really really big stuff. So if a researcher finds a really incriminating video on Youtube or some bad real estate records","25. The campaign will pass that stuff onto the reporter. This happens in several ways, sometimes they'll just give reporters records, other times they'll say \"look into X\", sometimes if its a complicated issue they'll sit down with the reporter and walk them through it. (cont)","26. What isn't done, again, is a reporter getting a pile of research thrown on their desk (\"oppo dump\") and they figure it out. Campaigns don't do this because they want to keep reporters focused on their narrative (good reporters aren't going to be guided by that, but..)","27. From the campaign perspective, you don't just dump stuff. Campaigns also try to carefully time the sharing of any research with reporters closer to Election Day...the October surprise is a real thing...Now, let's talk about a story that came out tonight","28. This story by @aterkel @mtredden about Amy Klobuchar's workplace conduct. So many people tweeted \"oppo dump!\" which is wrong. It wasn't and here's why, nothing that's in the story was publicly available. All based on sourcing https://t.co/qhWMiodmSB","29. Now this may have been from research if, for example, the reporting was based on ethics records that never got any attention. But most of the time stories like that come from reporters digging around, not researchers handing them stuff. Trust me, would make things easier!","30. So this story was about @aterkel @mtredden knowing about Klobuchar's reputation (which many people knew about) and calling around to sources to beef up the story, to back it up. That doesn't come from researchers. Researchers aren't private investigators.","31. I could go on all night but I just wanted to clear something up about who researchers are, what they do, and how they do it. It's truly above board work, it's not dark and nefarious.","32.

First, they'll commission a self-research packet (which often means several large binders/pdfs). In that packet... ~tweetbreak~ 9. They'll find every public statement (of note) they've ever made, donors or fundraisers that may cause issues for them (if they're smart they would vett donors before they take $$), everything re their voting record, videos - all the stuff I talked about earlier in the thread. ~tweetbreak~ 10. Then when they launch their campaign, a smart manager/general consultant won't have full research books done on every candidate. A book will only be done on one or two candidates at most normally but the manager will request top line hits on some other candidates ~tweetbreak~ 11. Top line hits mean that the researcher can put stuff together in a couple days usually and involve any tax liens, lawsuits, controversial videos/statements, bad business stuff etc. ~tweetbreak~ 12. Now, what researchers do that's so critical is they know, they have a sense of what matters in campaigns. They don't just plop all the information in a binder, they organize it in a way that prioritizes the information. They also, often, construct a narrative ~tweetbreak~ 13. So at the start of a book (if the researcher is good) you'll find basic information on the candidate, everything from DOB to addresses, marriages, children, social media accounts. Then you'll find a timeline of their life. From birth to present day. Timeline is critical ~tweetbreak~ 14. Because it allows the campaign team to understand where they may find more information OR (and this is where I talk about reporters)..its where they can guide reporters. So, for example, a press person can tell a reporter \"hey, Joe Smith lived in North Dakota for a year..\" ~tweetbreak~ 15. That may peak the reporters interest, that information may not have been easily available. The reporter may wonder why someone who spent their entire life in Southern California randomly lived in North Dakota for a year. Maybe there's something there? ~tweetbreak~ 16. Research books those two big sections are organized in sections after that (ex. voting record, real estate records etc). There are normally a few subsections on each page, a title for that subsection and then normally a paragraph of info under that section. Example... ~tweetbreak~ 17. \"Joe Smith Accepted $300,000 in donations from Oil Companies\" - then the paragraph may include something like this \"including $25,000 from Alan Jones who was fined by the EPA 120 separate times.\" All of this is publicly available. ~tweetbreak~ 18. Another section may start with something like this \"Joe Smith, When He Was A City Council Member, Repeatedly Prevented The Council From Settling With A Sexual Harassment Victim.\" Again, old records but public records. These are all great \"hits\" on a candidate ~tweetbreak~ 19. There's so much more and the thing that researchers get really good at is learning what will really make an impact. Think the oil company donations will make a difference? Probably not. What will make a difference? That Joe Smith had 20 unpaid parking tickets. ~tweetbreak~ 20. May sound silly to some but that's the kind of thing that pisses of voters and makes them wonder about that candidates ability to handle simple stuff. So here's a little something about researchers.. ~tweetbreak~ 21. Researchers are not shadowy figures who look like PIs in movies. They're nerdy, they look more like someone you'd find at the Genius Bar at Apple than an FBI. Field Office. Researchers are obsessive and odd. Soo many of the researchers I know are obsessed with unusual things ~tweetbreak~ 22. Several researchers I know are obsessed with learning languages like Greek and Latin. They get true joy from finding stuff no one else did. They're not driven by destroying someone but by uncovering the truth..no matter who it is about or where it is. ~tweetbreak~ 23. Ok so you have your research book...do you just hand it over to reporters? NO! I have never known anyone to ever do this..ever! Oppo dump is a ridiculous term. Most of the time, 99% of the research stays with the campaign. The candidate uses it to beef up on their opponent ~tweetbreak~ 24. The research is used for social media posts, debates (a big one), tv, digital, and radio ads, and for stump speeches. What is passed onto reporters? Really really big stuff. So if a researcher finds a really incriminating video on Youtube or some bad real estate records ~tweetbreak~ 25. The campaign will pass that stuff onto the reporter. This happens in several ways, sometimes they'll just give reporters records, other times they'll say \"look into X\", sometimes if its a complicated issue they'll sit down with the reporter and walk them through it. (cont) ~tweetbreak~ 26. What isn't done, again, is a reporter getting a pile of research thrown on their desk (\"oppo dump\") and they figure it out. Campaigns don't do this because they want to keep reporters focused on their narrative (good reporters aren't going to be guided by that, but..) ~tweetbreak~ 27. From the campaign perspective, you don't just dump stuff. Campaigns also try to carefully time the sharing of any research with reporters closer to Election Day...the October surprise is a real thing...Now, let's talk about a story that came out tonight ~tweetbreak~ 28. This story by @aterkel @mtredden about Amy Klobuchar's workplace conduct. So many people tweeted \"oppo dump!\" which is wrong. It wasn't and here's why, nothing that's in the story was publicly available. All based on sourcing https://t.co/qhWMiodmSB ~tweetbreak~ 29. Now this may have been from research if, for example, the reporting was based on ethics records that never got any attention. But most of the time stories like that come from reporters digging around, not researchers handing them stuff. Trust me, would make things easier! ~tweetbreak~ 30. So this story was about @aterkel @mtredden knowing about Klobuchar's reputation (which many people knew about) and calling around to sources to beef up the story, to back it up. That doesn't come from researchers. Researchers aren't private investigators. ~tweetbreak~ 31. I could go on all night but I just wanted to clear something up about who researchers are, what they do, and how they do it. It's truly above board work, it's not dark and nefarious. ~tweetbreak~ 32.

So let's talk about that a little.\n\nFirst, it's easy to say \"but whistleblower protections!\" That is the WORST POSSIBLE argument to use here. 2/ ~tweetbreak~ Intelligence community contractors didn't have whistleblower protections in 2013 when Snowden leaked. But the US government recognized what a problem this was and fixed it, right? Um, no. No they didn't. There may be a Snowden 2.0 festering in the IC right now as a result. 3/ ~tweetbreak~ What about \"he shouldn't have gone to Hong Kong\"? Okay, but this assumes that anyone who wants to leak illegal activity by the IC should be ready to go to prison themselves. I'm not sure I'm there. I want people to be able to out illegal activity without threat of prison. 4/ ~tweetbreak~ The there's the question of \"why did he go to Russian then\"? But that just demonstrates you don't know history (or refuse to Google). Russia was not the first country to offer Snowden asylum. Each country that offered before Russia withdrew the asylum offer. 5/ ~tweetbreak~ I can only assume there was a systematic operation by the State Department to pressure these other countries to withdraw their asylum offers. Russia just honey badgered it. Honestly, I think we created the Russia issue and it seems odd to focus on it now. 6/ ~tweetbreak~ Another popular argument is \"but Snowden must be giving Putin information now.\" I'm not sure I believe this. His very presence in Russia is a middle finger to the US. The US housed not-insignificant numbers of Soviet political refugees during the cold war for the same reason. 7/ ~tweetbreak~ Finally, I'll address \"but why did he take more information than the domestic surveillance program info\"? I think the simple answer is that Snowden didn't know what he didn't know. Ironically, the same who make the \"too much data\" argument like to hint at his lack of access. 8/ ~tweetbreak~ But we DO know that Snowden uncovered programs that effectively turned the Constitution into a Choose Your Own Adventure book. He watched DNI Clapper and Gen. Alexander (DIRNSA) lie about these programs, under oath, to oversight committees. This is indisputable. 9/ ~tweetbreak~ I do then think it's reasonable to ask \"what else don't I know?\" If you can get there, then I totally understand why he would take whatever he could get his hands on. If the goal is to leak data about illegal classified programs, why limit the scope? 10/ ~tweetbreak~ Anyway, I'll close with this:\n1. There is no question the IC was breaking the law. The public only knows about it because of Snowden.\n2. I'm no supporter of Snowden, but I also recognize this isn't a black and white issue. It's shades of grey. 11/ ~tweetbreak~ 3. Feel free to hold any opinion on his actions you want, but FFS educate yourself before sharing. For instance, before saying \"treason\" know the ACTUAL definition of the word and then be ready to explain how his actions amount to that. Any less is irresponsible hyperbole... 12/ ~tweetbreak~ 4. I won't be engaging sealions looking to argue in bad faith. I am not \"human Google.\" Use Google to seek out facts before responding/asking for clarification of my positions. 13/ ~tweetbreak~ 5. I spent a lot of time away from my family engineering legitimate intelligence collection missions. Many of those suffered substantially from information revealed by the press as a result of the Snowden leaks. There is no love here. \"Hate\" is too strong, but so is \"like\" 14/ ~tweetbreak~ 6.

In the early days of the pandemic, I saw debate develop between those advocating we listen to experts and those who felt we should listen to the data. This is a false dichotomy, let me say why...","This false dichotomy was concerning to me because analyzing data without scientific expertise is dangerous. Analysis needs to be grounded in real world experience (derived from experiments) of what is plausible. Without this, we can be worse off for having looked at the data.","A lot of people think asking questions of data is a foolproof way of learning more about the world. That as long as your statistics methodology is good and you have high-quality data, you will be smarter after you try to answer a question with data than before. This is not true.","You have to be careful about asking questions of data because badly framed questions can smuggle assumptions into your thought processes that actively make you more wrong than if you never tried to answer those questions at all.","\"What kind of cheese is the moon made of?\" is a bad question that will actively make you stupid. No amount of investigating what cheese most closely matches the properties of the moon will help you here. Good cheese data won't help you. State of the art algorithms won't help you.","The only thing that will help is to reject the question and go back to where you were before you asked it. You need to ask what material is the moon made of? Could it be cheese or something else? This seems obvious but people make this mistake in data analysis all the time.","\"Are covid-19 infection rates affected by racial genetics?\" is potentially one of these kinds of bad questions. In the context of looking at broad patterns between racial populations, it assumes too much. The point here is subtle so let me illustrate.","Is being likely to have spent time in my childhood home genetic? Presumably, my nuclear family has genes specific to us and we all lived there. My relatives have genes that are more like me and they are more likely to have spent time in the house than the general population.","I can promise you that if you get a dataset of people and try to figure out if being closely related to me makes you more likely to have spent time in my family home, you will see a beautiful pattern like my 1st cousins are more likely to be there than 2nd cousins and so on.","This is the genetics version of the cheese question. We assumed that living in the house was genetic and then we are narrowing down the genetic variants that cause it. This model predicts the past data, but it doesn't predict future data because it's not a causal pattern.","If you put those genes in a new person, they won't instinctively wander off in search of my childhood home.

In the early days of the pandemic, I saw debate develop between those advocating we listen to experts and those who felt we should listen to the data. This is a false dichotomy, let me say why... ~tweetbreak~ This false dichotomy was concerning to me because analyzing data without scientific expertise is dangerous. Analysis needs to be grounded in real world experience (derived from experiments) of what is plausible. Without this, we can be worse off for having looked at the data. ~tweetbreak~ A lot of people think asking questions of data is a foolproof way of learning more about the world. That as long as your statistics methodology is good and you have high-quality data, you will be smarter after you try to answer a question with data than before. This is not true. ~tweetbreak~ You have to be careful about asking questions of data because badly framed questions can smuggle assumptions into your thought processes that actively make you more wrong than if you never tried to answer those questions at all. ~tweetbreak~ \"What kind of cheese is the moon made of?\" is a bad question that will actively make you stupid. No amount of investigating what cheese most closely matches the properties of the moon will help you here. Good cheese data won't help you. State of the art algorithms won't help you. ~tweetbreak~ The only thing that will help is to reject the question and go back to where you were before you asked it. You need to ask what material is the moon made of? Could it be cheese or something else? This seems obvious but people make this mistake in data analysis all the time. ~tweetbreak~ \"Are covid-19 infection rates affected by racial genetics?\" is potentially one of these kinds of bad questions. In the context of looking at broad patterns between racial populations, it assumes too much. The point here is subtle so let me illustrate. ~tweetbreak~ Is being likely to have spent time in my childhood home genetic? Presumably, my nuclear family has genes specific to us and we all lived there. My relatives have genes that are more like me and they are more likely to have spent time in the house than the general population. ~tweetbreak~ I can promise you that if you get a dataset of people and try to figure out if being closely related to me makes you more likely to have spent time in my family home, you will see a beautiful pattern like my 1st cousins are more likely to be there than 2nd cousins and so on. ~tweetbreak~ This is the genetics version of the cheese question. We assumed that living in the house was genetic and then we are narrowing down the genetic variants that cause it. This model predicts the past data, but it doesn't predict future data because it's not a causal pattern. ~tweetbreak~ If you put those genes in a new person, they won't instinctively wander off in search of my childhood home. This kind of thing is why we need to be careful about looking at patterns in human data and thinking that these patterns automatically mean something is genetic. ~tweetbreak~ We need more evidence outside of just patterns. We need experiments to help us figure out plausible types of causation and we need to be careful about assuming everything that differs between races is genetic. Not only does it needlessly promote racism, it's often bad science. ~tweetbreak~ Thanks for coming to my TED talk.","author":"kareem_carr","date_posted":"Thu Jul 09 00:41:03 +0000 2020","first_tweet":"AS A STATISTICIAN, I respect science expertise because I need it to do my job right.

A short history thread. 1/ https://t.co/hby7lCmN2b","Robert Williams, a Black psychologist, came up with the name \"Ebonics\" in the 70s by combining Ebony and linguistics. Before that, our vernacular was widely known as \"nonstandard Negro English\" which puts us at a deviation from English, as opposed to Ebonics, our own dialect.","Educators has been studying how we spoke for decades and in the 80s and 90s teachers finally realized we were putting too many Black kids in special ed classes simply because of how we spoke at home and we should be doing what Norway was doing.","Norway has a lot of dialects. If a kid came in speaking a (making this name up) Crystal dialect, the teacher would say \"that's how you speak at home using these rules, and this is how those rules translate into standard Norweigian.\" They would use Crystal as a springboard.","In the US, we didn't do that. If you spoke Ebonics, your teacher would basically go \"that's wrong, don't say that\" and punish you OR you would score lower on IQ tests because no one had taught you how English relates to Ebonics.","Oakland says \"hmm...why don't we give our teachers the tools to understand Ebonics so when kids come in speaking it, they can relate the rules of Ebonics to the rules of standard English so the kids will speak both and score better on tests.\"","WHITE AMERICA THREW A FIT and tens of thousands of news stories in the mid 90s said that Oakland was trying to teach kids Ebonics.

A short history thread. 1/ https://t.co/hby7lCmN2b ~tweetbreak~ Robert Williams, a Black psychologist, came up with the name \"Ebonics\" in the 70s by combining Ebony and linguistics. Before that, our vernacular was widely known as \"nonstandard Negro English\" which puts us at a deviation from English, as opposed to Ebonics, our own dialect. ~tweetbreak~ Educators has been studying how we spoke for decades and in the 80s and 90s teachers finally realized we were putting too many Black kids in special ed classes simply because of how we spoke at home and we should be doing what Norway was doing. ~tweetbreak~ Norway has a lot of dialects. If a kid came in speaking a (making this name up) Crystal dialect, the teacher would say \"that's how you speak at home using these rules, and this is how those rules translate into standard Norweigian.\" They would use Crystal as a springboard. ~tweetbreak~ In the US, we didn't do that. If you spoke Ebonics, your teacher would basically go \"that's wrong, don't say that\" and punish you OR you would score lower on IQ tests because no one had taught you how English relates to Ebonics. ~tweetbreak~ Oakland says \"hmm...why don't we give our teachers the tools to understand Ebonics so when kids come in speaking it, they can relate the rules of Ebonics to the rules of standard English so the kids will speak both and score better on tests.\" ~tweetbreak~ WHITE AMERICA THREW A FIT and tens of thousands of news stories in the mid 90s said that Oakland was trying to teach kids Ebonics. Liberal and Conservative publications both trashed Oakland's idea and Ebonics became a bad word. ~tweetbreak~ No one was paying attention to what Oakland actually proposed -- which is taking kids who ALREADY KNOW EBONICS (so why would we have to teach them?) and relating English rules to those rules so they could switch more effectively and do better in school. ~tweetbreak~ A head start group famously ran this image of a MLK-like figure in the New York Times to protest Ebonics.

But most people don't understand how modern banking actually works.\n\nSpoiler Alert: It may shock you.\n\nHere's Banking 101!\n\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/M5XGedwtWS ~tweetbreak~ 1/ First, a bit of history.\n\nMost historians believe the earliest forms of banking began to appear around ~2000 BC in ancient India, Assyria, and Sumeria.\n\nAncient Greece and Rome expanded upon this legacy.\n\nBut banking transitioned into its more modern form in Renaissance Italy. https://t.co/OyqmqCDP5t ~tweetbreak~ 2/ In its most basic sense, the business of banking is very simple.\n\nTake money from depositors (deposits), pay them interest. Lend money to borrowers (using deposits), receive interest.\n\nAs long as the interest received exceeds the interest paid, the bank is happy / profitable. ~tweetbreak~ 3/ Historically, banks would maintain sufficient \"reserves\" (cash/metals) to give depositors their money back on request.\n\nThis is prudent, but limits the ability to create credit and thus may stifle investment in an economy.\n\nSo called \"fractional reserve banking\" changed that. ~tweetbreak~ 4/ Fractional reserve banking allows banks to only maintain a fraction of deposits in their reserves.\n\nIf the reserve requirement is 10%, a bank with $100 in deposits only has to maintain $10 in reserves.\n\nTo illustrate the beauty (and the beast!) of this system, here's a story. ~tweetbreak~ 5/ Imagine you arrive in a new town in California during the gold rush.\n\nYou get off the train with $1,000 in your pocket (and boundless ambition!).\n\nYou head over to the new CA Savings Bank and deposit the money into a bank account.\n\nYou are happy. https://t.co/UHyDzw9u48 ~tweetbreak~ 6/ CA Savings has a 10% reserve ratio, meaning it has to maintain 10% of your deposit in its reserves.\n\nIt places $100 in its reserves and lends the remaining $900 to Judson Adam, who uses it to buy gold pans.\n\nThe gold pan seller, Josiah Smith, deposits the $900 into CA Savings. ~tweetbreak~ 7/ CA Savings places $90 (10% of $900) in reserves and lends the remaining $810 to Jeremiah Black, who uses it to buy wheelbarrows.\n\nThe wheelbarrow seller, Johnson Campbell, decides to keep the cash in his pocket.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at what has happened here. ~tweetbreak~ 8/ Your original deposit of $1,000 at CA Savings started this chain, but there is now $2,710 of \"cash\" in circulation.\n\nYou: $1,000 at CA Savings\nJosiah: $900 at CA Savings\nJohnson: $810 in pocket\n\nThe fractional reserve banking model enabled the creation of credit/dollars. ~tweetbreak~ 9/ That is mostly a good thing.\n\nJudson and Jeremiah received loans that allowed them to spend, invest in equipment, start businesses, hire, etc.\n\nThe fractional reserve system enabled credit creation, which in turn sparked growth.\n\nSo that is the beauty.\n\nWhat about the beast? ~tweetbreak~ 10/ Say there is an earthquake. You get nervous, so you ask CA Savings for your $1,000 back.\n\nWell, they only have $190 of it (10% reserves from the $1,900 in deposits received).\n\nThey have to call in their loans (and halt any new lending) to meet your withdrawal.\n\nThis is bad. ~tweetbreak~ 11/ If the bank is unable to call its loans to meet withdrawals, it may be insolvent. Panic ensues. Credit contracts. The economy slumps.\n\nThe system can quickly unravel.\n\nThis is a highly simplified example - closed system, very few depositors and loans - but the basics hold. ~tweetbreak~ 12/ So you see, the modern fractional reserve banking system is both beauty and beast.\n\nIt enables the creation of credit, which may drive investment and growth.\n\nBut it also opens the door to rapid contractions, which tend to be self-fulfilling as panic begets more panic. ~tweetbreak~ 13/ I was inspired to do this primer after reading a great thread from @coloradotravis.

It is the 6th election in Belarusian history. Only 1994 election was deemed free and fair, and votes in 2001, 2006, 2010 and 2015 were marred by electoral fraud and government repression. \n\n1/x https://t.co/kboXUgGjHW","When the election was announced in early May 2020, it was expected that they would closely resemble the vote of 2015. During which Lukashenka, in power in Belarus since 1994, ran against the crowd of extras who did not really present any threats to him. \n\n2/x https://t.co/FFdi53IVMl","It quickly emerged that Lukashenka would be challenged from an unexpected front. Not by the the established opposition, mostly confined to identity politics, but by new figures - banker Viktar Babaryka, YouTube blogger Siarhei Tsikhanouski and ex-diplomat Valery Tsapkala. \n\n3/x https://t.co/j0364DEAZM","All these three challengers were ultimately eliminated from the race by the repressive state machine. Babaryka and Tsikhanouski got detained on dubious charges, and all three were ultimately not registered. But then an unexpected twist happened, which changed the race.\n\n4/x https://t.co/vYfOfP1cUN","Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of detained blogger, decided to run for presidency in his place. And she was ultimately registered as a candidate, as the sexist incumbent did not expect that a women, let alone a housewife can be a real challenge in this election.\n\n5/x https://t.co/Nku9klWk8n","On 14 July the Central Election Commission (CEC) registered Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya as one of the 5 presidential candidates. Two other alternative candidates - Viktar Babaryka and Valery Tsapkala were disqualified on alleged procedural grounds. \n\nhttps://t.co/0wdtlO0liu\n6/x https://t.co/KY60cUoZgi","Two days later Sviatlana united forces with campaigns of Babaryka (with his campaign chief Maryia Kalesnikava in the photo on the left) and Tsapkala (with his wife Veranika on the right). This  pulled together resources and people.\n\nhttps://t.co/a9PG0uuWhJ\n7/x","Social media in Belarus quickly responded to Tsikhanouskaya's candidacy - and her strongly feminist campaign, aided by other female politicians - with memes. And these memes clearly paint her as a favoured candidate for those on the internet:\n\n8/x https://t.co/rV1GoPjyxj","From late July Sviatlana and her team toured #Belarus gathering massive crowds of supporters - with up to 70,000 in Minsk and up to 20,000 in regional cities.

There's a saying that we \"only have 24 hours in a day,\" but without the Moon, we would probably be experiencing days that are between 6-12 hours, so good luck getting much work done then. Also, getting a decent amount of sleep would be difficult as... \n(12) ~tweetbreak~ well, since adults need around 8 hours. This means that we would have to completely change our calendar to account for this change, so instead of the usual 365 days that we have in a year, we would most likely have over 1,000 (I don't even want to imagine that). \n(13) https://t.co/wJvYnNyRnZ ~tweetbreak~ Now let's talk briefly about the biggest thing that the Moon affects on Earth: the tides. The Moon affects the tides by exerting a gravitational pull on them. This causes the water to bulge toward where the Moon is-AKA high tide. On the side of the Earth where the water... \n(14) ~tweetbreak~ does not bulge toward the Moon, it moves away-AKA low tide. These tides are also affected by the motion of the Earth while it's rotating. \nHere's a helpful graphic that I've used in a previous thread about if Earth had more than one moon: \n(15) https://t.co/qVMPnER0Ei ~tweetbreak~ Without the Moon and the gravitational pull that it provides, the tides would shrink. \"Scientists suggest that without the Moon, tides would be 1/3 of the size they are now\" (https://t.co/38aqqDYcSe). The Sun also influences tides, but its pull is much weaker, since it's... \n(16) ~tweetbreak~ further away from the earth than the Moon. This means that coastal areas would be affected and the economy of fishing and transporting things by boat would also be heavily impacted. \n(17) ~tweetbreak~ The Moon's pull is known to slow down the Earth's rotation, but if there wasn't a moon, then the Earth's rotation would be faster, which would influence our weather patterns and wind speeds (the wind speeds would increase without the Moon). \n(18) https://t.co/nNvv8rlGS7 ~tweetbreak~ If the change in weather doesn't interest you, then the dramatic change in seasons might. The Moon impacts the angle of Earth's tilt. Again, this is due to its gravitational pull. This is actually a good thing, because the Moon essentially keeps the Earth form wobbling. \n(19) https://t.co/PeJ2cHftEd ~tweetbreak~ It stabilizes where the Earth is tilted. Earth is at a 23.5 degree tilt, which does mean that it leans slightly more on one side than the other. This tilt is responsible for our seasons. If we didn't have a moon, the tilt would change, which would drastically affect the... \n(20) ~tweetbreak~ seasons and weather. There are two scenarios: we would either have a very extreme tilt with more extreme weather, or we would have virtually no tilt at all and basically no seasons. \n(21) https://t.co/1VSEoy9IF8 ~tweetbreak~ Final thoughts: As you could probably tell after reading all of this, the Moon is SUPER important for us, not only because of all of the vital components that it controls on Earth, but because it's the only other body that humans have been able to stand on apart from Earth! \n(22) https://t.co/0yHQhIlwbF ~tweetbreak~ I know that certain billionaires are trying to send people to Mars right now, but we don't know how far in the future that will be. \nWe may not even have gone into space at all if there wasn't a moon, and that's scary and sad to think about. \n(23)","author":"astro_jaz","date_posted":"Sun Aug 30 22:44:09 +0000 2020","first_tweet":"What if Earth had no moon? \u2716\ufe0f\ud83c\udf15 \n(1) https://t.co/pCoe7Wi7Ti","first_tweet_favorites":166,"first_tweet_retweets":50,"last_tweet":"I know that certain billionaires are trying to send people to Mars right now, but we don't know how far in the future that will be. \nWe may not even have gone into space at all if there wasn't a moon, and that's scary and sad to think about. \n(23)","link":"https://twitter.com/astro_jaz/status/1300202678295953408","num_tweets":23,"title":"What if Earth had no moon?","topic":"biology & climate;physics & maths","user_followers":6559},{"all_twt":["WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU HIT A \"CEILING\" IN LEARNING MATH?
